However, scholars often unwittingly distort treatment effect estimates by conditioning on variables that could be affected by their experimental manipulation. Typical examples include controlling for posttreatment variables in statistical models, eliminating observations based on posttreatment criteria, or subsetting the data based on posttreatment variables. Though these modeling choices are intended to address common problems encountered when conducting experiments, they can bias estimates of causal effects. Moreover, problems associated with conditioning on posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in the field, which we show frequently publishes experimental studies using these practices in our discipline's most prestigious journals. We demonstrate the severity of experimental posttreatment bias analytically and document the magnitude of the potential distortions it induces using visualizations and reanalyses of real-world data. We conclude by providing applied researchers with recommendations for best practice.},

Rather than focus on the movement as a product of specific historical, cultural, and political contexts, they defined it by a set of abstract theological principles. Then they identified those people from the colonial period to the present who fit their definition and who made positive contributions to North American history. The result was a new, singular, multi-century, “evangelical consensus” in the literature that decoupled the movement from politics, race, class, gender, and sexuality. I assess the historiography they created and then argue that we should drop the use of the term evangelical from our eighteenth- and nineteenth-century histories, and I offer a new definition of postwar evangelicalism that embeds it in its cultural context.},

	title = {A Genealogy of Digital Platform Regulation},
	volume = {7},
	abstract = {At its inception between the 1960s and 1990s, the internet was imagined as a decentralized, horizontal and open space that would foster freedom and equality. Today, it is a collection of walled gardens, a hierarchical ecosystem ruled by a few gatekeepers who leverage access to data, attention and infrastructural capability to enclose users and competitors in relations of dependency. The transition happened over the course of one, or at best two, decades. Why did the power of digital platform companies such as Google/Alphabet, Facebook/Meta, Amazon, and Apple emerge and grow so quickly without a regulatory response? An important reason is that the intellectual and institutional toolbox available to Western lawyers, policymakers, and thinkers is grossly inadequate to diagnosing and addressing harm and power formation in the information capitalist era. In this Article, I adopt a genealogical methodology to trace the evolution of digital platform regulation efforts and controversies. I connect current efforts to 1990s debates around the regulation of cyberspace: contestations on the meaning of freedom, law, power, and democracy in digital spaces. I isolate three paradigmatic views, or moments, in early Internet regulation discourse: anarcho-libertarian, liberal, and critical views. I ask how these three views or moments have shaped and led to a similar spectrum of three views on how to regulate digital platforms and promote freedom in digital spaces: libertarian aversion to regulation; liberal perspectives on self-regulation, fiduciary obligations, data protection, competition, and utility regulation; and critical accounts of platform governance. The move from an Internet of networks to an Internet of platforms represents a significant shift: from a hybrid, decentralized environment where freedom seemed the norm, to a centralized space where the default is privatized enclosure. Still, 1990s and current understandings of digital freedom, power, and law are pervaded by similar market-liberal path-dependencies that continue to facilitate the consolidation of private power in digital environments. I suggest two steps towards a post-neoliberal approach to digital policy.},

	abstract = {The relationship between housing costs and homelessness has important implications for the way that city and county governments respond to increasing homeless populations. Though many analyses in the public policy literature have examined inter-community variation in homelessness rates to identify causal mechanisms of homelessness [J. Urban Aff. 35 (2013) 607–625; J. Urban Aff. 25 (2003) 335–356; Am. J. Publ. Health 103 (2013) S340–S347], few studies have examined time-varying homeless counts within the same community [J. Mod. Appl. Stat. Methods 15 (2016) 15]. To examine trends in homeless population counts in the 25 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, we develop a dynamic Bayesian hierarchical model for time-varying homeless count data. Particular care is given to modeling uncertainty in the homeless count generating and measurement processes, and a critical distinction is made between the counted number of homeless and the true size of the homeless population. For each metro under study, we investigate the relationship between increases in the Zillow Rent Index and increases in the homeless population. Sensitivity of inference to potential improvements in the accuracy of point-in-time counts is explored, and evidence is presented that the inferred increase in the rate of homelessness from 2011–2016 depends on prior beliefs about the accuracy of homeless counts. A main finding of the study is that the relationship between homelessness and rental costs is strongest in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Seattle.},

In this paper, we identify points of structural change in the relationship between homeless rates and community-level measures of housing aﬀordability and extreme poverty. We utilize the Ewens-Pitman attraction distribution to develop a Bayesian nonparametric mixture model in which clusters of communities with similar covariates share common patterns of variation in homeless rates. A main ﬁnding of the study is that the expected homeless rate in a community increases sharply once median rental costs exceed 32\% of median income, providing statistical evidence for the widely used deﬁnition of a housing cost burden at 30\% of income. Our analysis also identiﬁes clusters of communities that exhibit distinct geographic patterns and yield insight into the homelessness and housing aﬀordability crisis unfolding on both coasts of the United States.},

It demonstrates that housing supply elasticity varies inversely with city size and transportation cost, and directly with cost of structure inputs and rural land in both classical and neoclassical models. Topographic features and planning regulations that reduce the share of land available for development do not influence supply elasticity if they apply uniformly. Finally, elasticity depends on the location within the city where housing prices are measured. These relations have the potential to confound empirical estimates of the determinants of housing supply elasticity, but are less problematic for numerical simulation models.},

Because of that, we tested the ability of an early neural network model, {ADAP}, to forecast the onset of diabetes mellitus in a high risk population of Pima Indians.

Most urbanists view sprawl as an expensive and unsustainable pattern of development. Yet a few defend it as simply a reflection of consumers' lifestyle preferences. In Perverse Cities, Pamela Blais argues that both views fail to recognize the market distortions and flawed policy that drive sprawl. Crude public policies and mis-pricing create hidden, "perverse" subsidies and incentives that promote sprawl while discouraging more efficient and sustainable urban forms � clearly not what most planners and environmentalists have in mind. Blais makes the case that accurate pricing and better policy are fundamental to curbing urban sprawl and shows how this can be achieved in practice through a range of market-oriented tools that promote efficient, sustainable cities.},

	abstract = {The property tax is the single largest source of revenue for American local governments. It is designed to be an ad valorem tax. The fairness and accuracy of the tax hinges on the quality of property valuation by local assessors. Using data from millions of residential real estate transactions, this paper shows that assessments are typically regressive, with low-priced properties being assessed at a higher value, relative to their actual sale price, than are high-priced properties. Within a jurisdiction, homes in the bottom decile of sale price face an assessment level, as a proportion of price, that is twice as high as that faced by homes in the top decile, on average. As a result, the property tax disproportionately burdens owners of less valuable homes. Such regressivity is evident throughout the {US}. This result cannot be explained by measurement error in sale prices, or by explicit policy choices, such as assessment limits. Rather, regressivity appears to result from limitations in the data and methods used in assessment.},

This creates the potential dilemma: The position that is best for the national party might be too extreme for the electorate in some states. Some state parties attempt to address this problem by adopting more moderate positions than their national-level counterparts. We argue that the efficacy of state party moderation hinges on the degree of polarization at the national level. We develop theory and examine empirical evidence that higher relative polarization at the national level exacerbates the degree to which national party positions and loyalties determine outcomes in U.S. state elections. When relative national polarization is high, we find evidence that state legislative election outcomes are determined by states’ orientations toward the national parties rather than the positions taken by state legislative parties.},

	abstract = {This Note examines whether public cloud infrastructure-as-a-service ({IaaS}) has a market structure that incentivizes a small number of cloud providers to engage in anticompetitive conduct to the detriment of competitors, competition, and ultimately consumers. As cloud {IaaS} becomes the dominant model for configuring and delivering computing resources in our increasingly cloud-based economy, the U.S. {IaaS} market is consolidating around a small number of players. These dominant players—Amazon, Microsoft and Google—also have a significant presence in downstream markets, which creates strong incentives for these providers to leverage their {IaaS} market power to distort competition in the diverse markets that depend on access to {IaaS}. While there is the potential for {IaaS} providers to act anticompetitively, the larger challenge is a structural one—ineffective competition, which results in a market structure that incentivizes anticompetitive conduct. Given the increasingly vital role cloud {IaaS} plays in our economy, as well as in our connected lives, important questions emerge as to whether national regulators should take steps to ensure consumers and competition are protected in the emerging cloud-based economy. This Note gives an overview of the {IaaS} market and examines whether the cost structure of the market has facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, the dominance of a small number of {IaaS} providers. It goes on to explore how consolidated control over {IaaS} incentivizes conduct that is potentially harmful to consumers and competitors in varied other markets that depend on access to {IaaS}. This Note finally explores possible industry and regulatory solutions for ensuring consumers and competition are protected in the emerging cloud-based economy.},

	shorttitle = {App Store Governance},
	abstract = {Much focus of the emerging research front known as platform governance is concerned with content moderation and other ways in which platform companies govern users and activity on their own platforms, as well as with how platforms are themselves governed by states (Gorwa, Inf Commun Soc 22(6): 854–871, 2019). Meanwhile, a related but distinct internet governance literature is concerned with what can be called “stack governance”: important but often unseen governance activities occurring elsewhere on the “tech stack”, beyond or behind platforms, apps and the open web (Donovan, Navigating the tech stack: When, where and how should we moderate content?. Centre for International Governance Innovation, 2019). A notable point of intersection between platform governance and stack governance is represented by app stores. Apple and Google hold an effective duopoly over smartphone software, with 99.2\% of devices worldwide running on either Apple’s {iOS} or Google’s Android software. Both provide a pre-installed app store through which most apps are discovered and downloaded. In addition to the oft-discussed competition concerns that this duopoly poses, Apple and Google’s dominance over app store governance poses broader societal dangers. This includes the risk of harms arising from the spread of dangerous content via apps, such as those claiming to deliver impossible health outcomes, or permitting hate speech, as well as concerns for democracy and accountability that arise from this duopolistic dominance. In order to illuminate these risks, we explore four emblematic episodes of app store governance: the prevalence of inefficacious health apps on Apple’s App Store; the decision to remove far-right platform Parler from app stores following the Capitol Riots in January 2021; Apple and Google’s initial rejection of a {UK} Covid-19 contact tracing app in 2020; and both companies’ removal of the Russian opposition “Smart Voting” app in 2021. Taken together, the cases we cover surface several considerations that we argue ought to shape legal, ethical, and technical approaches to app store governance—encompassing both how Apple and Google govern their app stores, and how the two companies themselves are and ought to be governed by states.},

Doubling up can have nega­ tive consequences that should be addressed, but the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s methods for enumerating homelessness exclude these arrangements, and Department of Education counts of dou­ bling up include only school children. We provide a new method for measur­ ing doubled-up homelessness in the total population using American Community Survey public use microdata. Using this method, we find that 3.7 million people in the U.S. population were doubled up in 2019 and show significant differences in doubling up by geography, race and ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, school enrollment, and employment status, and compare these findings with research on sheltered and unshel­ tered homelessness. Notably, rates of Hispanic/Latinx doubled-up homeless­ ness were high, in contrast to their rates of literal homelessness, and some rural areas with low rates of sheltered and unsheltered homelessness had high rates of doubling up. To aid in future research and policy, supplemental materials provide open-source tools for replicating the measure. Findings suggest that policies addressing homelessness and housing insecurity con­ sider those experiencing doubled-up homelessness and that the current measure can assist in those efforts.},

In particular, it focuses on whether states should be free to experiment with regulatory approaches or whether the federal government should have principal, if not exclusive (preemptive), regulatory authority over Internet-related activities. Using recent efforts to regulate spyware and adware as a case study, the analysis shows that the lack of harmonization of, and uncertainty surrounding, state unfair competition law produces costly, confusing, multi-district litigation and pushes enterprises to adhere to the limits of the most restrictive state. Such a governance regime unduly hinders innovation in Internet business models. On this basis, the Article favors a uniform federal regulatory system and preemption of state statutes and unfair competition common law as applied to spyware and adware. The final section of the Article extrapolates from this study of spyware and adware regulation to the larger context of Internet governance.},

	abstract = {In "Preemption and Privacy", Professor Paul Schwartz argues that it would be unwise for Congress to adopt a unitary federal information privacy statute that both eliminates the sector-specific distinctions in federal information privacy law and blocks the development of stronger state regulation. That conclusion, though narrow, rests on descriptive and normative claims with broad implications for the state-federal balance in information privacy law. Descriptively, Professor Schwartz sees the current information privacy law landscape as the product of successful experimentation at the state level. That account, in turn, fuels his normative claims, and in particular his sympathy with theories of competitive federalism. As I will argue, however, we cannot ignore the federal inputs— judicial and legislative — that shape significant segments of state information privacy law. The story of information privacy law is one of federal leadership as well as state experimentation, and we should be wary — whether on the basis of observable practice or theoretical perspective — of disabling Congress from articulating and federalizing privacy norms. Moreover, even from the perspective of competitive federalism, the arguments for federal regulation of information privacy law are stronger than Professor Schwartz suggests.},

	volume = {81},
	abstract = {One of Congress’s purposes in passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was to encourage the widespread deployment of broadband Internet. As municipalities began constructing their own broadband networks, private sector Internet service providers, alarmed at the prospect of competing with these public networks, pushed back with lobbying campaigns encouraging states to enact laws prohibiting these municipal networks. This, in turn, slowed broadband deployment, particularly in areas that private providers believed to be unprofitable (and thus left unserved). Municipalities challenged these laws under the Telecommunications Act, arguing that the Act preempted the state laws, but the Supreme Court in Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League, 541 U.S. 125 (2004), upheld the state prohibitions, clearing the way for even more states to adopt such prohibitions. Today, twenty-one states have statutes restricting municipal networks, leaving many Americans without affordable broadband Internet access.},

One helpful way to understand the structure of national Internets is by mapping autonomous system relationships within each country. Those autonomous systems are the {ISPs} and other large organizations that are responsible for routing traffic both within the larger Internet and within their own networks and as such act as points of technical and political control of the Internet.},

We uncover interactions between Internet service providers, legacy media organizations, commercial Internet companies, and the central and local governments ? each driven by discrete economic interests, political concerns, and imaginaries about the new technology. Delineating the emergence and consolidation of China's provincial web, our study foregrounds the understudied political economy of online content regionalization at scale. Further, it sheds new light on Chinese media policy, Internet governance, and Internet histories, especially the widely noted conservative turn of online cultures after the mid-2010s.},

It is enacted through capitalism and justified by the association of networked technologies with the political and social benefits of online community, drawing upon narratives that foreground the social and political benefits of networked technologies. I examine its origins in the wake of the dotcom bubble, when technology makers sought to develop a new business model to support online commerce. By leveraging user data for advertising purposes, they contributed to an information environment in which every action leaves behind traces collected by companies for commercial purposes. Through analysis of primary source materials produced by technology makers, journalists, and business analysts, I examine the emergence of data capitalism between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s and its central role in the contemporary information economy.},

	abstract = {Economists have studied the impact of numerous state laws, from welfare rules to voting {ID} requirements. Yet for all this policy evaluation, what do we know about policy diffusion—how these policies spread from state to state? We present a series of facts based on a data set of over 700 U.S. state policies spanning the past 7 decades. First, considering the introduction of new laws, state capacity seems to have a small role, in that larger and richer states are only slightly more likely to innovate policy. Second, the diffusion of policies from 1950 to 2000 is best predicted by proximity: a state is more likely to adopt a policy if nearby states have already done so. Third, instead since 2000, political alignment outperforms geographic proximity in predicting diffusion. Fourth, the diffusion of {COVID} state policies, as opposed to vaccination mandates since the 1970s, follows similar patterns of political polarization. Models of learning and correlated preferences could account for these patterns, including the decreased role of geography over time, if ideas spread more easily and preference correlation has become more political than geographical. We document, however, a role for party control: similarity in state party control predicts policy adoption in the last two decades, even controlling for voter political preferences. We conclude that party polarization has emerged as a key factor recently for policy adoption. Finally, building on these results, we broadly classify the patterns of policy diffusion in a set of difference-in-differences papers.},

	abstract = {Intense party polarization at the state and federal levels has hindered the adoption and implementation of numerous policies. One of the most important ways we see "fragmented federalism" is in the patchwork of policies across the country, created by factions and implemented in fragments across and within conflicted institutions throughout 2012-13. Implementation of various policies—notably education and health care—has been plagued by partisanship, pushback, and uncertainty. Operating under conditions of fiscal stress and a federal budget plagued by roadblocks has further complicated planning and program implementation at all government levels. Finally, Supreme Court decisions continue to contribute to the fragmented nature of federalism by alternately protecting state sovereignty from federal intrusion and at other times endorsing broad federal preemption of state laws.},

In spite of the popular aura of campaigns using secretive and sophisticated techniques to engage with voters, the book shows that most of what campaigns know about voters comes from a core set of public records. States vary in the kinds of records they collect from voters. Sometimes, state legislators pass laws about data collection for the very purpose of using government-collected personal data for their campaigns. The variation in data across the country means that campaign databases look different in different areas. Consequently, campaigns vary how they engage with voters in different areas because of the data that permit them to perceive voters' interests. Variations in data policy thus affect the kinds of electoral coalitions that campaigns build"--},
