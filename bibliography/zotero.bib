	abstract = {The ‘narco-frontier’ is frequently invoked in policy and popular narratives about drugs and armed conflict. The frontier is represented as an unruly, marginal and ‘ungoverned’ space, a magnate for drug traffickers, rebels and migrants. These ‘non state’ or ‘anti state’ spaces are believed to have a comparative advantage in illegality, with borderlands and frontiers becoming centres for the production, consumption and trafficking of illicit drugs. Linked to this representation is a policy narrative and set of assumptions that statebuilding, peacebuilding, development and counter narcotics policies are mutually reinforcing, and involve the extension of a state presence into these frontier zones, along with effective drug eradication, substitution and development activities. In spite of the evident inaccuracy of this portrayal of the ‘narco-frontier’ the imaginary is extremely resilient and continues to be reflected and reinforced in policy texts and narratives. This paper asks why has this been the case. What ideological work does the imaginary perform and for whom? And what are the implications of an alternative imaginary of the margins?},

In 2010 when online voter registration was newly introduced in eight states, we conducted a field experiment with 25 colleges involving more than 130,000 unregistered students designed to increase awareness of the new registration tool. Students were randomly assigned to receive an email linking to the new registration portal, receive an email linking to the older downloadable registration form, or a control group that received no email about voter registration. Student registry data was then checked against voter files to look at relative rates of registration and voter turnout across treatment conditions. We estimate that linking to the downloadable form increased registration rates by 0.6 percentage points and did not affect turnout rates at all. In contrast, emails linking to the online registration portal increased registration rates by 1.2 percentage points and turnout rates by 0.5 percentage points, which are large effects relative to other mobilization techniques.},

Since 1990, at least 60,000 people have been killed-insurgents, civilians, and military and police personnel. In 2019, the conflict entered a dangerous new phase. India's Hindu nationalist government, under Narendra Modi, repealed Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir's autonomous status and divided it into two territories subject to New Delhi's direct rule. The drastic move was accompanied by mass arrests and lengthy suspension of mobile and internet services. In this definitive account, Sumantra Bose examines the conflict in Kashmir from its origins to the present volatile juncture. He explores the global context of the current situation, including China's growing role, as well as the human tragedy of the people caught in the bitter dispute. Drawing on three decades of field experience in Kashmir, Bose asks whether a compromise settlement is still possible given the ascendancy of Hindu nationalism in India and the complex geopolitical context"--},

	abstract = {This article studies the conditions that lead peripheral minorities to identify with the state, their ethnic group, or neighboring countries. We contribute to research on separatism and irredentism by examining how violence, psychological distance, and national status determine identification. The analysis uses data from a novel experiment that randomized videos of actual violence in a large, representative survey of the Kashmir Valley region in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, an enduring site of separatist and irredentist conflict. We find that a strong regional identity is a counter-weight to irredentism, but violent repression by the state can push members of the minority to identify with an irredentist neighbor. Violence increases perceived distance from the nation and reduces national identification. There is suggestive evidence that these effects are concentrated among individuals with attributes that otherwise predict higher levels of identification with the state. Information about integrative institutions and increased national status brought about by economic growth is insufficient to induce national identification in a context where psychological distance from the nation is large.},

The model is also intended to help legislators and regulators adapt their legal and regulatory frameworks to the Internet. This Article canvasses and builds upon the burgeoning development of Internet law. It suggests that the Internet's impact on economic regulation is best understood by classifying its effects into four categories, each of which requires a different regulatory response. It also considers potential solutions for adapting economic regulation to the Internet. This Article concludes that no single suitable solution or analogy remedies the regulatory challenges posed by the Internet. Rather, as in real space, a combination of approaches is necessary to create an effective regulatory framework.},

In particular, it focuses on whether states should be free to experiment with regulatory approaches or whether the federal government should have principal, if not exclusive (preemptive), regulatory authority over Internet-related activities. Using recent efforts to regulate spyware and adware as a case study, the analysis shows that the lack of harmonization of, and uncertainty surrounding, state unfair competition law produces costly, confusing, multi-district litigation and pushes enterprises to adhere to the limits of the most restrictive state. Such a governance regime unduly hinders innovation in Internet business models. On this basis, the Article favors a uniform federal regulatory system and preemption of state statutes and unfair competition common law as applied to spyware and adware. The final section of the Article extrapolates from this study of spyware and adware regulation to the larger context of Internet governance.},

	abstract = {Economic scholarship has recently focused a great deal of attention on the phenomenon of network externalities, or network effects: markets in which the value that consumers place on a good increases as others use the good. Though the economic theory of network effects is of recent origin and is still not thoroughly understood, network effects increasingly play a role in legal argument. Judges, litigators, and scholars have suggested that antitrust law, intellectual property law, telecommunications law, Internet law, corporate law, and contract law need to be modified to take account of network effects. Their arguments reflect a wide range of views about what network effects are and how courts should react to them. In this Article, we explore the application of network economic theory in each of these contexts. We suggest ways in which particular legal rules should-and should not-be modified to take account of network effects. We also attempt to draw some general conclusions about the role of network economic theory in the legal enterprise and about the way in which courts should revise legal doctrines in response to theories from fields outside the law.},

	abstract = {A classic constitutional parable teaches that our federal system of government allows states to function as “laboratories of democracy.” This tale has been passed down from generation to generation, often to justify constitutional protections for state autonomy from the federal government. But scholars have failed to explain how state governments manage to overcome numerous impediments to experimentation, including resource scarcity, free rider problems, and misaligned incentives. This Article maintains that the laboratories account is missing a proper appreciation for the coordinated networks of third-party organizations (such as interest groups, activists, and funders) that often fuel policy innovation. These groups are the real laboratories of democracy today. They perform the lion’s share of tasks necessary to enact new policies; they create incentives that motivate elected officials to support their preferred policies; and they mobilize the power of the federal government to change the landscape against which state experimentation occurs. If our federal system of government seeks to encourage policy experimentation, then courts should endeavor to create ground rules for regulating competition between political networks, rather than continuing futile efforts to protect state autonomy. This Article concludes by sketching some implications for several areas of legal doctrine, including federal preemption of state law, conditional spending, and the anticommandeering principle.},

In this Article, Professor Bebchuk offers an analysis of the dynamics and performance of state charter competition. He shows how the presence of managerial opportunism and externalities may lead states to adopt undesirable corporate law rules. Professor Bebchuk identifies the various issues with respect to which state competition is likely to fail, and he advocates an expansion of federal regulation to govern all of these issues. He also connects the state competition question with the question of contractual freedom in corporate law and argues that many scholars should reconsider their inconsistent views regarding these two questions. Finally, Professor Bebchuk concludes by addressing potential objections to the expansion of federal corporate regulation.},

	abstract = {Seed dispersal syndromes are morphological characters of seeds correlated to particular seed dispersal agents. Dispersal is the event by which individuals move from the site of their parents to establish in a new area. A seed disperser is the vector by which a seed moves from its parent to the resting place where the individual will establish, for instance an animal. Similar to the term syndrome, a diaspore is a morphological functional unit of a seed for dispersal purposes.Characteristics for seed dispersal syndromes are commonly fruit colour, mass, and persistence. These syndrome characteristics are often associated with the fruit that carries the seeds. Fruits are packages for seeds, composed of nutritious tissues to feed animals. However, fruit pulp is not commonly used as a seed dispersal syndrome because pulp nutritional value does not enhance seed dispersal success. Animals interact with these fruits because they are a common food source for them. Although, not all seed dispersal syndromes have fruits because not all seeds are dispersed by animals. Suitable biological and environmental conditions of dispersal syndromes are needed for seed dispersal  and invasion success  such as temperature and moisture.
Seed dispersal syndromes are parallel to pollination syndromes, which are defined as floral characteristics that attract organisms as pollinators. They are considered parallels because they are both plant-animal interactions, which increase the reproductive success of a plant. However, seed dispersal syndromes are more common in gymnosperms, while pollination syndromes are found in angiosperms.
Seeds disperse to increase the reproductive success of the plant. The farther away a seed is from a parent, the better its chances of survival and germination. Therefore, a plant should select certain traits to increase dispersal by a vector (i.e. bird) to increase the reproductive success of the plant.},

	abstract = {Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is about using regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. Unlike other books, it focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for experiments and observational studies. They make a smooth transition to logistic regression and {GLM}. The emphasis is on computation in R and Stan rather than derivations, with code available online. Graphics and presentation aid understanding of the models and model fitting},

We explain how the inclusion of machine learning in the social sciences requires us to rethink not only applications of machine learning methods but also best practices in the social sciences. In contrast to the traditional tasks for machine learning in computer science and statistics, when machine learning is applied to social scientific data, it is used to discover new concepts, measure the prevalence of those concepts, assess causal effects, and make predictions. The abundance of data and resources facilitates the move away from a deductive social science to a more sequential, interactive, and ultimately inductive approach to inference. We explain how an agnostic approach to machine learning methods focused on the social science tasks facilitates progress across a wide range of questions.},

	isbn = {978-0-203-78821-9},
	shorttitle = {Introduction to Linear Algebra},
	abstract = {This is the first book on linear algebra written specifically for social scientists. It deals only with those aspects of the subject applicable in the social sciences and provides a thorough understanding of linear algebra for those who wish to use it as a tool in the design, execution, and interpretation of research. Linear mathematical models play an important role in all of the social sciences. This book provides a step-by-step introduction to those parts of linear algebra which are useful in such model building. It illustrates some of the applications of linear analysis and helps the reader learn how to convert his formulation of a social science problem into algebraic terms. The author covers matrix algebra, computational methods, linear models involving discrete variables, and clear, complete explanations of necessary mathematical concepts. Prior knowledge of calculus is not required since no use is made of calculus or of complex numbers. A novel feature of the mathematical content of the book is the treatment of models expressed in terms of variables which must be whole numbers (integers). The book is distinguished by a step-by-step exposition that allows the reader to grasp quickly and fully the principles of linear algebra. All of the examples used to illustrate the text are drawn from the social sciences, enabling the reader to relate the subject to concrete problems in his field. Exercises are included as a necessary part of the text to develop points not covered in the text and to provide practice in the algebraic formulation of applied problems. An appendix gives solutions (or hints) for selected exercises.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

Face recognition algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function that predicts the presence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: How do these new empirical tools fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Machine learning not only provides new tools, it solves a different problem. Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or their output is misinterpreted. We hope to make them conceptually easier to use by providing a crisper understanding of how these algorithms work, where they excel, and where they can stumble—and thus where they can be most usefully applied.},

In this telling, the revolt represents an antigovernment, antiliberal shift among white homeowners instrumental in the “rise of the right” and the fall of the “New Deal order” that culminated in Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980 and his subsequent tax cuts. This article challenges that account by demonstrating that the revolt began more than a decade before Prop 13 as approval rates for local levies and bonds reached all-time lows. This local revolt was not limited to whites, nor did it portend rising conservatism. Instead, it was rooted in lower- and middle-income Americans’ frustrations with steep rises in unfair, regressive taxes during the post–World War {II} decades. The Kennedy-Johnson “Growth Liberals,” who were busy cutting progressive federal taxes at the same time that regressive state and local taxes were soaring, missed this pocketbook squeeze, thereby setting the stage for later events like Prop 13.},

Previous studies have indicated that it is costly to provide public services in areas with low-density, spatially expansive development, leading to higher per capita expenditures. However, theory would suggest alternate outcomes. This paper examines this question using a panel dataset of U.S. urban county areas and a specification allowing for potential nonlinearity between development patterns and per capita expenditures. Estimates indicate that the spatial extent of development is the most important factor in expenditures; it is less costly to provide public services when development is more compact. Higher density increases per capita expenditures; however, the effects are small.},

	abstract = {Proposition 13 gutted California's property tax system in 1978. Most people think that the tax-revolt initiative was caused by excessive government spending and rising tax burdens on homeowners. I argue that the California Supreme Court's landmark decision, Serrano v. Priest (1971), crippled the Tiebout system by divorcing local property wealth from school spending. Serrano thus converted most property taxes into a deadweight loss. Voters responded by rejecting the property tax, shifting the school finance burden to the state. My explanation supports the median voter model in contrast to Leviathan theories of state and local government.},

Among these are education, income, political attentiveness, voter participation, and age. This analysis, using questions from a 2005 and a 2009 California Field Poll, shows that all of those predictors are associated with not only a lack of accurate understanding, but actual misinformation when it comes to basic comprehension of California’s Proposition 13. This is a unique finding, in that misinformation is concentrated among those who ought to be most politically aware. Several possible explanations for this bizarre phenomenon are explored. This is especially interesting, since the misunderstanding persists 31 years after the passage of the landmark tax measure.},
