However, scholars often unwittingly distort treatment effect estimates by conditioning on variables that could be affected by their experimental manipulation. Typical examples include controlling for posttreatment variables in statistical models, eliminating observations based on posttreatment criteria, or subsetting the data based on posttreatment variables. Though these modeling choices are intended to address common problems encountered when conducting experiments, they can bias estimates of causal effects. Moreover, problems associated with conditioning on posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in the field, which we show frequently publishes experimental studies using these practices in our discipline's most prestigious journals. We demonstrate the severity of experimental posttreatment bias analytically and document the magnitude of the potential distortions it induces using visualizations and reanalyses of real-world data. We conclude by providing applied researchers with recommendations for best practice.},

Rather than focus on the movement as a product of specific historical, cultural, and political contexts, they defined it by a set of abstract theological principles. Then they identified those people from the colonial period to the present who fit their definition and who made positive contributions to North American history. The result was a new, singular, multi-century, “evangelical consensus” in the literature that decoupled the movement from politics, race, class, gender, and sexuality. I assess the historiography they created and then argue that we should drop the use of the term evangelical from our eighteenth- and nineteenth-century histories, and I offer a new definition of postwar evangelicalism that embeds it in its cultural context.},

	title = {A Genealogy of Digital Platform Regulation},
	volume = {7},
	abstract = {At its inception between the 1960s and 1990s, the internet was imagined as a decentralized, horizontal and open space that would foster freedom and equality. Today, it is a collection of walled gardens, a hierarchical ecosystem ruled by a few gatekeepers who leverage access to data, attention and infrastructural capability to enclose users and competitors in relations of dependency. The transition happened over the course of one, or at best two, decades. Why did the power of digital platform companies such as Google/Alphabet, Facebook/Meta, Amazon, and Apple emerge and grow so quickly without a regulatory response? An important reason is that the intellectual and institutional toolbox available to Western lawyers, policymakers, and thinkers is grossly inadequate to diagnosing and addressing harm and power formation in the information capitalist era. In this Article, I adopt a genealogical methodology to trace the evolution of digital platform regulation efforts and controversies. I connect current efforts to 1990s debates around the regulation of cyberspace: contestations on the meaning of freedom, law, power, and democracy in digital spaces. I isolate three paradigmatic views, or moments, in early Internet regulation discourse: anarcho-libertarian, liberal, and critical views. I ask how these three views or moments have shaped and led to a similar spectrum of three views on how to regulate digital platforms and promote freedom in digital spaces: libertarian aversion to regulation; liberal perspectives on self-regulation, fiduciary obligations, data protection, competition, and utility regulation; and critical accounts of platform governance. The move from an Internet of networks to an Internet of platforms represents a significant shift: from a hybrid, decentralized environment where freedom seemed the norm, to a centralized space where the default is privatized enclosure. Still, 1990s and current understandings of digital freedom, power, and law are pervaded by similar market-liberal path-dependencies that continue to facilitate the consolidation of private power in digital environments. I suggest two steps towards a post-neoliberal approach to digital policy.},

	abstract = {The relationship between housing costs and homelessness has important implications for the way that city and county governments respond to increasing homeless populations. Though many analyses in the public policy literature have examined inter-community variation in homelessness rates to identify causal mechanisms of homelessness [J. Urban Aff. 35 (2013) 607–625; J. Urban Aff. 25 (2003) 335–356; Am. J. Publ. Health 103 (2013) S340–S347], few studies have examined time-varying homeless counts within the same community [J. Mod. Appl. Stat. Methods 15 (2016) 15]. To examine trends in homeless population counts in the 25 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, we develop a dynamic Bayesian hierarchical model for time-varying homeless count data. Particular care is given to modeling uncertainty in the homeless count generating and measurement processes, and a critical distinction is made between the counted number of homeless and the true size of the homeless population. For each metro under study, we investigate the relationship between increases in the Zillow Rent Index and increases in the homeless population. Sensitivity of inference to potential improvements in the accuracy of point-in-time counts is explored, and evidence is presented that the inferred increase in the rate of homelessness from 2011–2016 depends on prior beliefs about the accuracy of homeless counts. A main finding of the study is that the relationship between homelessness and rental costs is strongest in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Seattle.},

In this paper, we identify points of structural change in the relationship between homeless rates and community-level measures of housing aﬀordability and extreme poverty. We utilize the Ewens-Pitman attraction distribution to develop a Bayesian nonparametric mixture model in which clusters of communities with similar covariates share common patterns of variation in homeless rates. A main ﬁnding of the study is that the expected homeless rate in a community increases sharply once median rental costs exceed 32\% of median income, providing statistical evidence for the widely used deﬁnition of a housing cost burden at 30\% of income. Our analysis also identiﬁes clusters of communities that exhibit distinct geographic patterns and yield insight into the homelessness and housing aﬀordability crisis unfolding on both coasts of the United States.},

It demonstrates that housing supply elasticity varies inversely with city size and transportation cost, and directly with cost of structure inputs and rural land in both classical and neoclassical models. Topographic features and planning regulations that reduce the share of land available for development do not influence supply elasticity if they apply uniformly. Finally, elasticity depends on the location within the city where housing prices are measured. These relations have the potential to confound empirical estimates of the determinants of housing supply elasticity, but are less problematic for numerical simulation models.},

Because of that, we tested the ability of an early neural network model, {ADAP}, to forecast the onset of diabetes mellitus in a high risk population of Pima Indians.

Most urbanists view sprawl as an expensive and unsustainable pattern of development. Yet a few defend it as simply a reflection of consumers' lifestyle preferences. In Perverse Cities, Pamela Blais argues that both views fail to recognize the market distortions and flawed policy that drive sprawl. Crude public policies and mis-pricing create hidden, "perverse" subsidies and incentives that promote sprawl while discouraging more efficient and sustainable urban forms � clearly not what most planners and environmentalists have in mind. Blais makes the case that accurate pricing and better policy are fundamental to curbing urban sprawl and shows how this can be achieved in practice through a range of market-oriented tools that promote efficient, sustainable cities.},

	abstract = {The property tax is the single largest source of revenue for American local governments. It is designed to be an ad valorem tax. The fairness and accuracy of the tax hinges on the quality of property valuation by local assessors. Using data from millions of residential real estate transactions, this paper shows that assessments are typically regressive, with low-priced properties being assessed at a higher value, relative to their actual sale price, than are high-priced properties. Within a jurisdiction, homes in the bottom decile of sale price face an assessment level, as a proportion of price, that is twice as high as that faced by homes in the top decile, on average. As a result, the property tax disproportionately burdens owners of less valuable homes. Such regressivity is evident throughout the {US}. This result cannot be explained by measurement error in sale prices, or by explicit policy choices, such as assessment limits. Rather, regressivity appears to result from limitations in the data and methods used in assessment.},

This creates the potential dilemma: The position that is best for the national party might be too extreme for the electorate in some states. Some state parties attempt to address this problem by adopting more moderate positions than their national-level counterparts. We argue that the efficacy of state party moderation hinges on the degree of polarization at the national level. We develop theory and examine empirical evidence that higher relative polarization at the national level exacerbates the degree to which national party positions and loyalties determine outcomes in U.S. state elections. When relative national polarization is high, we find evidence that state legislative election outcomes are determined by states’ orientations toward the national parties rather than the positions taken by state legislative parties.},

	abstract = {This Note examines whether public cloud infrastructure-as-a-service ({IaaS}) has a market structure that incentivizes a small number of cloud providers to engage in anticompetitive conduct to the detriment of competitors, competition, and ultimately consumers. As cloud {IaaS} becomes the dominant model for configuring and delivering computing resources in our increasingly cloud-based economy, the U.S. {IaaS} market is consolidating around a small number of players. These dominant players—Amazon, Microsoft and Google—also have a significant presence in downstream markets, which creates strong incentives for these providers to leverage their {IaaS} market power to distort competition in the diverse markets that depend on access to {IaaS}. While there is the potential for {IaaS} providers to act anticompetitively, the larger challenge is a structural one—ineffective competition, which results in a market structure that incentivizes anticompetitive conduct. Given the increasingly vital role cloud {IaaS} plays in our economy, as well as in our connected lives, important questions emerge as to whether national regulators should take steps to ensure consumers and competition are protected in the emerging cloud-based economy. This Note gives an overview of the {IaaS} market and examines whether the cost structure of the market has facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, the dominance of a small number of {IaaS} providers. It goes on to explore how consolidated control over {IaaS} incentivizes conduct that is potentially harmful to consumers and competitors in varied other markets that depend on access to {IaaS}. This Note finally explores possible industry and regulatory solutions for ensuring consumers and competition are protected in the emerging cloud-based economy.},

	shorttitle = {App Store Governance},
	abstract = {Much focus of the emerging research front known as platform governance is concerned with content moderation and other ways in which platform companies govern users and activity on their own platforms, as well as with how platforms are themselves governed by states (Gorwa, Inf Commun Soc 22(6): 854–871, 2019). Meanwhile, a related but distinct internet governance literature is concerned with what can be called “stack governance”: important but often unseen governance activities occurring elsewhere on the “tech stack”, beyond or behind platforms, apps and the open web (Donovan, Navigating the tech stack: When, where and how should we moderate content?. Centre for International Governance Innovation, 2019). A notable point of intersection between platform governance and stack governance is represented by app stores. Apple and Google hold an effective duopoly over smartphone software, with 99.2\% of devices worldwide running on either Apple’s {iOS} or Google’s Android software. Both provide a pre-installed app store through which most apps are discovered and downloaded. In addition to the oft-discussed competition concerns that this duopoly poses, Apple and Google’s dominance over app store governance poses broader societal dangers. This includes the risk of harms arising from the spread of dangerous content via apps, such as those claiming to deliver impossible health outcomes, or permitting hate speech, as well as concerns for democracy and accountability that arise from this duopolistic dominance. In order to illuminate these risks, we explore four emblematic episodes of app store governance: the prevalence of inefficacious health apps on Apple’s App Store; the decision to remove far-right platform Parler from app stores following the Capitol Riots in January 2021; Apple and Google’s initial rejection of a {UK} Covid-19 contact tracing app in 2020; and both companies’ removal of the Russian opposition “Smart Voting” app in 2021. Taken together, the cases we cover surface several considerations that we argue ought to shape legal, ethical, and technical approaches to app store governance—encompassing both how Apple and Google govern their app stores, and how the two companies themselves are and ought to be governed by states.},

Doubling up can have nega­ tive consequences that should be addressed, but the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s methods for enumerating homelessness exclude these arrangements, and Department of Education counts of dou­ bling up include only school children. We provide a new method for measur­ ing doubled-up homelessness in the total population using American Community Survey public use microdata. Using this method, we find that 3.7 million people in the U.S. population were doubled up in 2019 and show significant differences in doubling up by geography, race and ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, school enrollment, and employment status, and compare these findings with research on sheltered and unshel­ tered homelessness. Notably, rates of Hispanic/Latinx doubled-up homeless­ ness were high, in contrast to their rates of literal homelessness, and some rural areas with low rates of sheltered and unsheltered homelessness had high rates of doubling up. To aid in future research and policy, supplemental materials provide open-source tools for replicating the measure. Findings suggest that policies addressing homelessness and housing insecurity con­ sider those experiencing doubled-up homelessness and that the current measure can assist in those efforts.},

In particular, it focuses on whether states should be free to experiment with regulatory approaches or whether the federal government should have principal, if not exclusive (preemptive), regulatory authority over Internet-related activities. Using recent efforts to regulate spyware and adware as a case study, the analysis shows that the lack of harmonization of, and uncertainty surrounding, state unfair competition law produces costly, confusing, multi-district litigation and pushes enterprises to adhere to the limits of the most restrictive state. Such a governance regime unduly hinders innovation in Internet business models. On this basis, the Article favors a uniform federal regulatory system and preemption of state statutes and unfair competition common law as applied to spyware and adware. The final section of the Article extrapolates from this study of spyware and adware regulation to the larger context of Internet governance.},

	abstract = {In "Preemption and Privacy", Professor Paul Schwartz argues that it would be unwise for Congress to adopt a unitary federal information privacy statute that both eliminates the sector-specific distinctions in federal information privacy law and blocks the development of stronger state regulation. That conclusion, though narrow, rests on descriptive and normative claims with broad implications for the state-federal balance in information privacy law. Descriptively, Professor Schwartz sees the current information privacy law landscape as the product of successful experimentation at the state level. That account, in turn, fuels his normative claims, and in particular his sympathy with theories of competitive federalism. As I will argue, however, we cannot ignore the federal inputs— judicial and legislative — that shape significant segments of state information privacy law. The story of information privacy law is one of federal leadership as well as state experimentation, and we should be wary — whether on the basis of observable practice or theoretical perspective — of disabling Congress from articulating and federalizing privacy norms. Moreover, even from the perspective of competitive federalism, the arguments for federal regulation of information privacy law are stronger than Professor Schwartz suggests.},

	volume = {81},
	abstract = {One of Congress’s purposes in passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was to encourage the widespread deployment of broadband Internet. As municipalities began constructing their own broadband networks, private sector Internet service providers, alarmed at the prospect of competing with these public networks, pushed back with lobbying campaigns encouraging states to enact laws prohibiting these municipal networks. This, in turn, slowed broadband deployment, particularly in areas that private providers believed to be unprofitable (and thus left unserved). Municipalities challenged these laws under the Telecommunications Act, arguing that the Act preempted the state laws, but the Supreme Court in Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League, 541 U.S. 125 (2004), upheld the state prohibitions, clearing the way for even more states to adopt such prohibitions. Today, twenty-one states have statutes restricting municipal networks, leaving many Americans without affordable broadband Internet access.},

One helpful way to understand the structure of national Internets is by mapping autonomous system relationships within each country. Those autonomous systems are the {ISPs} and other large organizations that are responsible for routing traffic both within the larger Internet and within their own networks and as such act as points of technical and political control of the Internet.},

We uncover interactions between Internet service providers, legacy media organizations, commercial Internet companies, and the central and local governments ? each driven by discrete economic interests, political concerns, and imaginaries about the new technology. Delineating the emergence and consolidation of China's provincial web, our study foregrounds the understudied political economy of online content regionalization at scale. Further, it sheds new light on Chinese media policy, Internet governance, and Internet histories, especially the widely noted conservative turn of online cultures after the mid-2010s.},

It is enacted through capitalism and justified by the association of networked technologies with the political and social benefits of online community, drawing upon narratives that foreground the social and political benefits of networked technologies. I examine its origins in the wake of the dotcom bubble, when technology makers sought to develop a new business model to support online commerce. By leveraging user data for advertising purposes, they contributed to an information environment in which every action leaves behind traces collected by companies for commercial purposes. Through analysis of primary source materials produced by technology makers, journalists, and business analysts, I examine the emergence of data capitalism between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s and its central role in the contemporary information economy.},

	abstract = {Economists have studied the impact of numerous state laws, from welfare rules to voting {ID} requirements. Yet for all this policy evaluation, what do we know about policy diffusion—how these policies spread from state to state? We present a series of facts based on a data set of over 700 U.S. state policies spanning the past 7 decades. First, considering the introduction of new laws, state capacity seems to have a small role, in that larger and richer states are only slightly more likely to innovate policy. Second, the diffusion of policies from 1950 to 2000 is best predicted by proximity: a state is more likely to adopt a policy if nearby states have already done so. Third, instead since 2000, political alignment outperforms geographic proximity in predicting diffusion. Fourth, the diffusion of {COVID} state policies, as opposed to vaccination mandates since the 1970s, follows similar patterns of political polarization. Models of learning and correlated preferences could account for these patterns, including the decreased role of geography over time, if ideas spread more easily and preference correlation has become more political than geographical. We document, however, a role for party control: similarity in state party control predicts policy adoption in the last two decades, even controlling for voter political preferences. We conclude that party polarization has emerged as a key factor recently for policy adoption. Finally, building on these results, we broadly classify the patterns of policy diffusion in a set of difference-in-differences papers.},

One of the most important ways we see "fragmented federalism" is in the patchwork of policies across the country, created by factions and implemented in fragments across and within conflicted institutions throughout 2012-13. Implementation of various policies—notably education and health care—has been plagued by partisanship, pushback, and uncertainty. Operating under conditions of fiscal stress and a federal budget plagued by roadblocks has further complicated planning and program implementation at all government levels. Finally, Supreme Court decisions continue to contribute to the fragmented nature of federalism by alternately protecting state sovereignty from federal intrusion and at other times endorsing broad federal preemption of state laws.},

States vary in the kinds of records they collect from voters. Sometimes, state legislators pass laws about data collection for the very purpose of using government-collected personal data for their campaigns. The variation in data across the country means that campaign databases look different in different areas. Consequently, campaigns vary how they engage with voters in different areas because of the data that permit them to perceive voters' interests. Variations in data policy thus affect the kinds of electoral coalitions that campaigns build"--},

Scholars have sought to answer these questions in terms of geographic proximity and social-psychological identity, but neither concept can accommodate the contestation and change that characterize the social construction of regions. Instead, this article argues that the limits of regions are defined within regional organizations by member states’ governments plus supranational actors deliberating over a common definition of the characteristics that members and potential members are expected to share. The concept of membership norms thus offers powerful insights into how regional communities define who is eligible for membership, how these definitions change over time and the incentives they create for those seeking to promote or block an applicant state. The evolution of the European Union’s membership norms since the 1950s illustrates this argument.},

The regime's epistemic community believed that telecommunications services and equipment were best supplied by national monopolies and that international communications by telephone, telegram, and telex should be jointly provided by monopolists. Strong domestic political incentives reinforced this cognitive framework. When technological innovation triggered a successful political attack on the domestic regulation of telecommunications in a few key countries, the stage was set for a global challenge to the intellectual and political foundations of the regime. Two paths to reform have emerged. Their significance can be assessed by looking at changes in the distribution of benefits from the regime, changes in the manner in which governments delegate power to the regime, and shifts in the epistemic community associated with the regime.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to examine the influence of private corporations in the tripartite structure of the International Telecommunications Union ({ITU}): Telecommunications Standardization, Radiocommunication, and Telecommunications Development. The paper finds that, in the standardization sector, power has been effectively transferred from nation states to the private corporate sector since the approval process now enables standards to be approved by members of the study group that developed them, which is essentially the private sector. In the radiocommunication sector, the private sector continues to conduct much of the requisite technical work, but national governments are ultimately the decision makers and, further, it is difficult to distinguish between treaty and nontreaty work. In the development sector, the {ITU} seeks to create an enabling environment for private investment in developing countries and actively seeks to build private sector partnerships. In the long run the {ITU} may be unable to satisfy either its narrow corporate constituency or the vast majority of its developing country members. As the United Nations agency which coordinates satellite spacing and allocates access to the electromagnetic spectrum on an international basis, the {ITU} is the world's most prominent international telecommunications institution, so its structural modifications and membership changes are of great significance in a world increasingly dependent on a global grid of wired and wireless telecommunications networks.},

	volume = {59},
	issn = {0020-8183},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/3877878},
	abstract = {The concept of power is central to international relations. Yet disciplinary discussions tend to privilege only one, albeit important, form: an actor controlling another to do what that other would not otherwise do. By showing conceptual favoritism, the discipline not only overlooks the different forms of power in international politics, but also fails to develop sophisticated understandings of how global outcomes are produced and how actors are differentially enabled and constrained to determine their fates. We argue that scholars of international relations should employ multiple conceptions of power and develop a conceptual framework that encourages rigorous attention to power in its different forms. We first begin by producing a taxonomy of power. Power is the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate. This general concept entails two crucial, analytical dimensions: the kinds of social relations through which power works (in relations of interaction or in social relations of constitution); and the specificity of social relations through which effects are produced (specific/direct or diffuse/indirect). These distinctions generate our taxonomy and four concepts of power: compulsory, institutional, structural, and productive. We then illustrate how attention to the multiple forms of power matters for the analysis of global governance and American empire. We conclude by urging scholars to beware of the idea that the multiple concepts are competing, and instead to see connections between them in order to generate more robust understandings of how power works in international politics.},

	shorttitle = {Imagining the U.s.-Mexico Drug War},
	abstract = {In the last decade, violence attributed to Latin American drug cartels has become a common theme in a proliferation of fiction and non-fiction about the drug trade written both in Mexico and the U.S. This essay shows how the majority of Mexican narconarratives—in particular the works of writers such as Orfa Alarcón, Yuri Herrera, Élmer Mendoza, Heriberto Yépez, and Juan Pablo Villalobos—while conceived as critical literary interventions, are in fact marketable commodities reproducing hegemonic discourses that frame the drug trade as a phenomenon operating outside of the state. Mexican narconarratives reify a mythology of drug cartels and their kingpins: that the violence threatening the country is attributable only to narcos, who radically oppose civil society and its government. However, there is an emerging current of narconarratives that articulate an effective critique of the drug trade as a dimension located within state structures, historically determined by state power and subject to it. The novels analyzed include Contrabando (Contraband) by Mexican author Víctor Hugo Rascón Banda, 2666 by Chilean author Roberto Bolaño, and The Power of the Dog and Down by the River by U.S. writers Don Winslow and Charles Bowden, respectively. Reconsidering the classical notion of mimesis, this essay contends that, despite their varying proximity to their common referent—the drug trade—and their differing practices of realism, most narco-narratives replicate official representations of drug cartels. It is through a critical approach to the drug trade, as it intersects the power of the state, that alternative narconarratives resist the mediation of hegemonic discourses that permeate the fields of journalism, academic research, and literature.},

The frontier is represented as an unruly, marginal and ‘ungoverned’ space, a magnate for drug traffickers, rebels and migrants. These ‘non state’ or ‘anti state’ spaces are believed to have a comparative advantage in illegality, with borderlands and frontiers becoming centres for the production, consumption and trafficking of illicit drugs. Linked to this representation is a policy narrative and set of assumptions that statebuilding, peacebuilding, development and counter narcotics policies are mutually reinforcing, and involve the extension of a state presence into these frontier zones, along with effective drug eradication, substitution and development activities. In spite of the evident inaccuracy of this portrayal of the ‘narco-frontier’ the imaginary is extremely resilient and continues to be reflected and reinforced in policy texts and narratives. This paper asks why has this been the case. What ideological work does the imaginary perform and for whom? And what are the implications of an alternative imaginary of the margins?},

In 2010 when online voter registration was newly introduced in eight states, we conducted a field experiment with 25 colleges involving more than 130,000 unregistered students designed to increase awareness of the new registration tool. Students were randomly assigned to receive an email linking to the new registration portal, receive an email linking to the older downloadable registration form, or a control group that received no email about voter registration. Student registry data was then checked against voter files to look at relative rates of registration and voter turnout across treatment conditions. We estimate that linking to the downloadable form increased registration rates by 0.6 percentage points and did not affect turnout rates at all. In contrast, emails linking to the online registration portal increased registration rates by 1.2 percentage points and turnout rates by 0.5 percentage points, which are large effects relative to other mobilization techniques.},

	abstract = {"The India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir is one of the world's incendiary conflicts. Since 1990, at least 60,000 people have been killed-insurgents, civilians, and military and police personnel. In 2019, the conflict entered a dangerous new phase. India's Hindu nationalist government, under Narendra Modi, repealed Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir's autonomous status and divided it into two territories subject to New Delhi's direct rule. The drastic move was accompanied by mass arrests and lengthy suspension of mobile and internet services. In this definitive account, Sumantra Bose examines the conflict in Kashmir from its origins to the present volatile juncture. He explores the global context of the current situation, including China's growing role, as well as the human tragedy of the people caught in the bitter dispute. Drawing on three decades of field experience in Kashmir, Bose asks whether a compromise settlement is still possible given the ascendancy of Hindu nationalism in India and the complex geopolitical context"--},

We contribute to research on separatism and irredentism by examining how violence, psychological distance, and national status determine identification. The analysis uses data from a novel experiment that randomized videos of actual violence in a large, representative survey of the Kashmir Valley region in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, an enduring site of separatist and irredentist conflict. We find that a strong regional identity is a counter-weight to irredentism, but violent repression by the state can push members of the minority to identify with an irredentist neighbor. Violence increases perceived distance from the nation and reduces national identification. There is suggestive evidence that these effects are concentrated among individuals with attributes that otherwise predict higher levels of identification with the state. Information about integrative institutions and increased national status brought about by economic growth is insufficient to induce national identification in a context where psychological distance from the nation is large.},

It suggests that the Internet's impact on economic regulation is best understood by classifying its effects into four categories, each of which requires a different regulatory response. It also considers potential solutions for adapting economic regulation to the Internet. This Article concludes that no single suitable solution or analogy remedies the regulatory challenges posed by the Internet.

In particular, it focuses on whether states should be free to experiment with regulatory approaches or whether the federal government should have principal, if not exclusive (preemptive), regulatory authority over Internet-related activities. Using recent efforts to regulate spyware and adware as a case study, the analysis shows that the lack of harmonization of, and uncertainty surrounding, state unfair competition law produces costly, confusing, multi-district litigation and pushes enterprises to adhere to the limits of the most restrictive state. Such a governance regime unduly hinders innovation in Internet business models. On this basis, the Article favors a uniform federal regulatory system and preemption of state statutes and unfair competition common law as applied to spyware and adware. The final section of the Article extrapolates from this study of spyware and adware regulation to the larger context of Internet governance.},

Though the economic theory of network effects is of recent origin and is still not thoroughly understood, network effects increasingly play a role in legal argument. Judges, litigators, and scholars have suggested that antitrust law, intellectual property law, telecommunications law, Internet law, corporate law, and contract law need to be modified to take account of network effects. Their arguments reflect a wide range of views about what network effects are and how courts should react to them. In this Article, we explore the application of network economic theory in each of these contexts. We suggest ways in which particular legal rules should-and should not-be modified to take account of network effects. We also attempt to draw some general conclusions about the role of network economic theory in the legal enterprise and about the way in which courts should revise legal doctrines in response to theories from fields outside the law.},

	abstract = {A classic constitutional parable teaches that our federal system of government allows states to function as “laboratories of democracy.” This tale has been passed down from generation to generation, often to justify constitutional protections for state autonomy from the federal government. But scholars have failed to explain how state governments manage to overcome numerous impediments to experimentation, including resource scarcity, free rider problems, and misaligned incentives. This Article maintains that the laboratories account is missing a proper appreciation for the coordinated networks of third-party organizations (such as interest groups, activists, and funders) that often fuel policy innovation. These groups are the real laboratories of democracy today. They perform the lion’s share of tasks necessary to enact new policies; they create incentives that motivate elected officials to support their preferred policies; and they mobilize the power of the federal government to change the landscape against which state experimentation occurs. If our federal system of government seeks to encourage policy experimentation, then courts should endeavor to create ground rules for regulating competition between political networks, rather than continuing futile efforts to protect state autonomy. This Article concludes by sketching some implications for several areas of legal doctrine, including federal preemption of state law, conditional spending, and the anticommandeering principle.},

In this Article, Professor Bebchuk offers an analysis of the dynamics and performance of state charter competition. He shows how the presence of managerial opportunism and externalities may lead states to adopt undesirable corporate law rules. Professor Bebchuk identifies the various issues with respect to which state competition is likely to fail, and he advocates an expansion of federal regulation to govern all of these issues. He also connects the state competition question with the question of contractual freedom in corporate law and argues that many scholars should reconsider their inconsistent views regarding these two questions. Finally, Professor Bebchuk concludes by addressing potential objections to the expansion of federal corporate regulation.},

	abstract = {Seed dispersal syndromes are morphological characters of seeds correlated to particular seed dispersal agents. Dispersal is the event by which individuals move from the site of their parents to establish in a new area. A seed disperser is the vector by which a seed moves from its parent to the resting place where the individual will establish, for instance an animal. Similar to the term syndrome, a diaspore is a morphological functional unit of a seed for dispersal purposes.Characteristics for seed dispersal syndromes are commonly fruit colour, mass, and persistence. These syndrome characteristics are often associated with the fruit that carries the seeds. Fruits are packages for seeds, composed of nutritious tissues to feed animals. However, fruit pulp is not commonly used as a seed dispersal syndrome because pulp nutritional value does not enhance seed dispersal success. Animals interact with these fruits because they are a common food source for them. Although, not all seed dispersal syndromes have fruits because not all seeds are dispersed by animals. Suitable biological and environmental conditions of dispersal syndromes are needed for seed dispersal  and invasion success  such as temperature and moisture.
Seed dispersal syndromes are parallel to pollination syndromes, which are defined as floral characteristics that attract organisms as pollinators. They are considered parallels because they are both plant-animal interactions, which increase the reproductive success of a plant. However, seed dispersal syndromes are more common in gymnosperms, while pollination syndromes are found in angiosperms.
Seeds disperse to increase the reproductive success of the plant. The farther away a seed is from a parent, the better its chances of survival and germination. Therefore, a plant should select certain traits to increase dispersal by a vector (i.e. bird) to increase the reproductive success of the plant.},

It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for experiments and observational studies.

We explain how the inclusion of machine learning in the social sciences requires us to rethink not only applications of machine learning methods but also best practices in the social sciences. In contrast to the traditional tasks for machine learning in computer science and statistics, when machine learning is applied to social scientific data, it is used to discover new concepts, measure the prevalence of those concepts, assess causal effects, and make predictions. The abundance of data and resources facilitates the move away from a deductive social science to a more sequential, interactive, and ultimately inductive approach to inference. We explain how an agnostic approach to machine learning methods focused on the social science tasks facilitates progress across a wide range of questions.},

It deals only with those aspects of the subject applicable in the social sciences and provides a thorough understanding of linear algebra for those who wish to use it as a tool in the design, execution, and interpretation of research. Linear mathematical models play an important role in all of the social sciences. This book provides a step-by-step introduction to those parts of linear algebra which are useful in such model building. It illustrates some of the applications of linear analysis and helps the reader learn how to convert his formulation of a social science problem into algebraic terms. The author covers matrix algebra, computational methods, linear models involving discrete variables, and clear, complete explanations of necessary mathematical concepts. Prior knowledge of calculus is not required since no use is made of calculus or of complex numbers. A novel feature of the mathematical content of the book is the treatment of models expressed in terms of variables which must be whole numbers (integers). The book is distinguished by a step-by-step exposition that allows the reader to grasp quickly and fully the principles of linear algebra. All of the examples used to illustrate the text are drawn from the social sciences, enabling the reader to relate the subject to concrete problems in his field. Exercises are included as a necessary part of the text to develop points not covered in the text and to provide practice in the algebraic formulation of applied problems. An appendix gives solutions (or hints) for selected exercises.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

	abstract = {Machines are increasingly doing “intelligent” things. Face recognition algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function that predicts the presence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: How do these new empirical tools fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Machine learning not only provides new tools, it solves a different problem. Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or their output is misinterpreted. We hope to make them conceptually easier to use by providing a crisper understanding of how these algorithms work, where they excel, and where they can stumble—and thus where they can be most usefully applied.},

	shorttitle = {Stirrings of Revolt},
	abstract = {In most accounts, the modern American “tax revolt” begins with Proposition 13, passed by California voters in June 1978. In this telling, the revolt represents an antigovernment, antiliberal shift among white homeowners instrumental in the “rise of the right” and the fall of the “New Deal order” that culminated in Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980 and his subsequent tax cuts. This article challenges that account by demonstrating that the revolt began more than a decade before Prop 13 as approval rates for local levies and bonds reached all-time lows. This local revolt was not limited to whites, nor did it portend rising conservatism. Instead, it was rooted in lower- and middle-income Americans’ frustrations with steep rises in unfair, regressive taxes during the post–World War {II} decades. The Kennedy-Johnson “Growth Liberals,” who were busy cutting progressive federal taxes at the same time that regressive state and local taxes were soaring, missed this pocketbook squeeze, thereby setting the stage for later events like Prop 13.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the fiscal impacts of urban development patterns in the United States. Previous studies have indicated that it is costly to provide public services in areas with low-density, spatially expansive development, leading to higher per capita expenditures. However, theory would suggest alternate outcomes. This paper examines this question using a panel dataset of U.S. urban county areas and a specification allowing for potential nonlinearity between development patterns and per capita expenditures. Estimates indicate that the spatial extent of development is the most important factor in expenditures; it is less costly to provide public services when development is more compact. Higher density increases per capita expenditures; however, the effects are small.},

Most people think that the tax-revolt initiative was caused by excessive government spending and rising tax burdens on homeowners. I argue that the California Supreme Court's landmark decision, Serrano v. Priest (1971), crippled the Tiebout system by divorcing local property wealth from school spending. Serrano thus converted most property taxes into a deadweight loss. Voters responded by rejecting the property tax, shifting the school finance burden to the state. My explanation supports the median voter model in contrast to Leviathan theories of state and local government.},

The package uses a logistic regression model to analyze political choice data, usually (though not exclusively) from a legislative setting. In contrast to other scaling methods, W-{NOMINATE} explicitly assumes probabilistic voting based on a spatial utility function, where the parameters of the utility function and the spatial coordinates of the legislators and the votes can all be estimated on the basis of observed voting behavior. Building on the W-{NOMINATE} software written by Poole in {FORTRAN}, the new package facilitates easier data input and manipulation, generates bootstrapped standard errors, and includes a new suite of graphics functions to display the results. We demonstrate the functionality of this package by conducting a natural experiment using roll calls —an experiment which is greatly simpliﬁed by the data manipulation capabilities of the W-{NOMINATE} package in R.},

	abstract = {"State legislatures hold tremendous authority over key facets of our lives, in domains ranging from healthcare to education to election administration. And in an era of polarization and frequent policy gridlock at the national level, their significance has only increased. Political scientist Steven Rogers asks what voters know about state legislators, whether they have a meaningful opportunity to register their preferences in state legislative elections, and if there is evidence of accountability for performance in the outcomes of those elections. Drawing on broad-ranging evidence and creative research strategies, Rogers shows that, most often, state legislatures can produce policies contrary to citizens' priorities with little fear of being held accountable at the ballot box. Assembling an encyclopedic range of data on candidacy and retirements, lawmaker issue stances, news coverage, general elections, primaries, electoral competition, legislator effectiveness, state economic performance, public opinion, voter knowledge, and election outcomes, this book foregrounds a major issue: Voters do not know enough about their state representatives. They are often not presented with alternatives in elections where incumbents routinely run unopposed, and outcomes normally fail to correlate with indicators of legislative performance, either for individual lawmakers or in the aggregate performance of state government"--},

Then we address the problem of solving {NMF}, which is {NP}-hard in general. We review some standard {NMF} algorithms, and also present a recent subclass of {NMF} problems, referred to as near-separable {NMF}, that can be solved efficiently (that is, in polynomial time), even in the presence of noise --this is the how. Finally, we briefly describe some problems in mathematics and computer science closely related to {NMF} via the nonnegative rank.},

	abstract = {Non-negative matrix factorization ({NMF}) has previously been shown to 
be a useful decomposition for multivariate data. Two different multi- 
plicative algorithms for {NMF} are analyzed. They differ only slightly in 
the multiplicative factor used in the update rules. One algorithm can be 
shown to minimize the conventional least squares error while the other 
minimizes the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence. The monotonic 
convergence of both algorithms can be proven using an auxiliary func- 
tion analogous to that used for proving convergence of the Expectation- 
Maximization algorithm. The algorithms can also be interpreted as diag- 
onally rescaled gradient descent, where the rescaling factor is optimally 
chosen to ensure convergence.},

	abstract = {The analysis and visualization of weighted networks pose many challenges, which have led to the development of techniques for extracting the network's backbone, a subgraph composed of only the most significant edges. Weighted edges are particularly common in bipartite projections (e.g. networks of co-authorship, co-attendance, co-sponsorship), which are often used as proxies for one-mode networks where direct measurement is impractical or impossible (e.g. networks of collaboration, friendship, alliance). However, extracting the backbone of bipartite projections requires special care. This paper reviews existing methods for extracting the backbone from bipartite projections, and proposes a new method that aims to overcome their limitations. The stochastic degree sequence model ({SDSM}) involves the construction of empirical edge weight distributions from random bipartite networks with stochastic marginals, and is demonstrated using data on bill sponsorship in the 108th U.S. Senate. The extracted backbone's validity as a network reflecting political alliances and antagonisms is established through comparisons with data on political party affiliations and political ideologies, which offer an empirical ground-truth. The projection and backbone extraction methods discussed in this paper can be performed using the -onemode- command in Stata.},

We first identify the stakeholders of this conflict, which are the rights holders on the one hand – that is, creators, producers and distributors of audio-visual content – and the consumers of audio-visual content on the other. We also identify their interests, moral rights and moral intuitions based on interviews with representatives of the interested parties and by conducting an analysis of their position papers on the Digital Single Market strategy initiatives presented by the European Commission in the years 2015 to 2018. The moral rights and legitimate interests of stakeholders are then balanced and specified. We propose four ethical principles that set out the conditions under which the geo-blocking of audio-visual content is either ethically justified or unjustified.},

	abstract = {Geoblocking has been presented both as an evil perpetrated against the Internet and as the savior of content on the Internet. The European Commission regards geoblocking as undesirable and aims to eliminate geoblocking within the European Union to the extent possible. Although the Commission’s 2015 proposed cross-border portability regulation and its 2016 proposed anti-geoblocking regulation would not eliminate geoblocking entirely, the two regulations would significantly limit the instances in which geoblocking would be legal. Content creators, such as motion picture studios, take a different position on geoblocking: they see geoblocking as a helpful means to partition markets, maintain distribution schedules, and secure financing based on territorially-defined distribution. For content providers such as small online radio stations, geoblocking may be the only way to conduct business if these stations rely on affordable, but territorially-limited, licenses. This article reviews the recent legal developments concerning geoblocking and considers whether the future of the Internet can and should include geoblocking. Recent developments suggest that geoblocking is receiving a greater role in the legal context: legislators, courts, and regulators are considering geoblocking as an effective and necessary means of territorially limiting on the Internet the effects of their laws, judgments, and decisions. Because there are no uniform global laws that would govern activities on the Internet without respect to where those activities occur in the world, some form of geoblocking might be needed to address specific circumstances.},

The per curiam opinion upheld large portions of the {FCC}’s 2018 Restoring Internet Freedom Order, but also undermined the {FCC}’s preemption of state law while also remanding issues related to public safety, pole attachments, and the Lifeline Program to the agency, assuring that the legal and policy battles over net neutrality will continue. This Article traces the history of the {FCC}’s efforts on net neutrality as it has moved in and out of court since the {FCC}’s 2005 Policy Statement before exploring the decision in Mozilla. The Article then argues that the continuing uncertainty over net neutrality regulation should be resolved by Congress.},

	abstract = {In Reno v. {ACLU} and Packingham v. North Carolina, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government-enacted restrictions on online speech must pass strict scrutiny review. Even so, efforts to compel and restrict speech appearing in private venues like social media continue to expand in scope and number at both the state and federal level. We first explore Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L. in the context of student speech cases before discussing how the decision destroys the traditional boundary of the schoolhouse gate for the regulation of student speech. It does so despite the fact that the cheerleader's profane messages would have been protected expression in any nonschool situation. We then argue that Mahanoy, despite being an individual win for the cheerleader, illustrates how the Court continues to wrestle with traditional applications of the First Amendment to internet speech. We argue that the decision has the regulation of internet speech following a path similar to the regulation of broadcast speech.},

	abstract = {For five decades, the Federal Communications Commission ({FCC}) has struggled to implement policies that promote minority ownership of broadcast stations. Four “Prometheus” decisions from the Third Circuit span a seventeen-year legal impasse that highlighted the agency’s shortcomings on effective minority ownership policies. Now, after the Supreme Court’s 2021 decision in {FCC} v. Prometheus Radio Project, the {FCC} is required to relaunch its media ownership policy in 2022. This paper explores how the {FCC} has interpreted diversity in media ownership policymaking by examining a range of diversity policies and assessment methodologies particularly regarding minority ownership. The paper then presents data from a thirty-year period to demonstrate that the impasse of the Prometheus cases corresponded with significant growth in minority station ownership. Results of a series of independent empirical tests examining the connection between ownership and diversity, and assessing the diversity of content production in broadcast radio by company size and ownership by race and ethnicity, are discussed in the context of the legal rulings.},

	abstract = {Transborder flow of digitized goods and services has become a major feature in the debate over Internet regulation.  Some commentators have argued that the architecture of the Internet changes everything; others have replied that it changes nothing.  This updated article addresses federalism issues raised by on-line interjurisdictional competition, arguing that despite the suggestions of the "unexceptionalist" school of commentary, Internet regulation remains anything but "business as usual."  Analysis of interstate competition in law as a product is appropriate in determining the proper scope of state regulation of on-line activity. Two lines of constitutional cases define the parameters of proper interstate regulatory competition: those dealing with personal jurisdiction, and those dealing with the dormant commerce clause. Inherent in the Supreme Court's Due Process holdings is the principle that interstate diversity in law products is desireable and central to a federal system. The minimum contacts test of International Shoe and subsequent cases preserves the individual's right to vote with his feet in selecting among the law products offered by the several states. Competition for law as a product can only be maintained if states are prevented from externalizing the costs of their local regulations. The Supreme Court holdings regarding the dormant commerce clause indicate that this constitutional doctrine serves to prevent states from exporting their law products to other jurisdictions by attempting to control wholly extraterritorial activity. Although the Internet may in some cases facilitate externalization of state regulatory costs, centralized regulation by the federal government, rather than overreaching by the states, is the proper solution to such externalities.},

It does so in intervals of five years over a 25-year period, using fiscal observations for 31,804 units of local government in 787 metropolitan counties across the contiguous United States. Specifically explored is the effect of tax and expenditure limitations on the variation in revenues and expenditures between general purpose governments and school districts within county areas. Rather than imposing a uniform constraint across jurisdictions, tax and expenditure limitations (℡s) are associated with increased variation across both general purpose and school district revenues and expenditures and, by implication, increased service differentials. Effects are found to be asymmetric, with increased variation greatest within counties comprising the urban core and those with relatively more disadvantaged populations. The implications are that ℡s are most constraining on the ability of governments serving economically less prosperous and at risk populations to meet public service needs. Such differential effects are of more than questionable merit and are the result of the application of blunt instruments to what is often an undemonstrated need. The outcome impairs both the efficiency and responsiveness of the local public sector.},

To test our research hypothesis, this study focuses on a cross-section of municipalities throughout the U.S. during and shortly after the 2008-09 recession. Using multiple data sources from the Government Finance Officers Association ({GFOA}) and American Community Survey ({ACS}), we employ a panel data from 2008 to 2011 which covers the period of the Great Recession to best capture cutback strategies during a period of severe fiscal distress. We observed differences in fiscal outcomes based on the severity of the municipal {TELs}. Municipalities constrained by more stringent {TELs} received more intergovernmental aid, incurred higher debt service expenditures and experienced less net capital investment during the most recent recessionary period. These findings support the argument that {TELs}, which are often neglected in discussions of cutback strategies, should be given greater consideration. This study helps shed light on the theoretical and empirical investigations of cutback strategies by offering the concept of institutional constraints and its impact on cutback strategies.},

With rapid inflation of home prices and modern assessment practices, the share of property taxes impacting on homeowners tends to rise.

The default tool for studying voter behavior — regressions of vote choice on voter characteristics — is useful for evaluating correlates and determinants of vote choice, but is incapable of assessing how many votes a group contributes. Accounting for votes also requires knowing a group’s size and its turnout rate. We introduce a set of tools for estimating how many votes a bloc gives to a candidate, how voting bloc patterns diﬀer from prior elections, and how support changes under counterfactuals. We apply these tools to study U.S. presidential elections, demonstrating that there is little evidence to show Black and Latino voters are shifting toward Republicans in recent elections and that Donald Trump’s support was concentrated among voters with moderate attitudes toward racial outgroups.},

	abstract = {This dissertation analyses the dynamics of {EU} policy making through a structured and focused comparison with two other federal polities: the United States and Switzerland. To this end, it draws on the wider comparative federalism literature to examine how basic federal political institutions structure the development of policy outcomes. The empirical focus is on the regulatory challenge posed by the internet's spectacular proliferation during the period of 1995-2005. Two hypotheses are formulated as to how basic federal political institutions shape the development of policy outcomes in the three polities under investigation. First, given the cross-border nature of the policy challenge, we expect to find similar interactions among the different levels of government in all three units of analysis. In particular, federal level political actors should be similarly mobilised into offering centralising solutions to problems with cross-border effects. Furthermore, this could provoke allocational shifts in authority towards the centre in the three units of analysis. Second, it is expected that differences in the policy process and the ‘power capabilities’ of the centre help to explain the variance in policy outcomes. The main findings of the empirical investigation suggest that the dynamics of policymaking in the realm of internet regulation exhibit similarities that make {EU} comparison with other federal polities across these dimensions especially revealing. This is particularly the case when comparing the {EU} with polities characterised by an extremely decentralised federal configuration, institutionally weak centres, consensual modes of decision-making, and decentralised modes of policy implementation such as Switzerland.},

	abstract = {What has been the impact of the state and local tax and expenditures limitations ({TELs}) movement of the 1970s and 1980s? Focusing on the consequences of different types of {TELs} for revenue and expenditure structure, Philip Joyce and Daniel Mullins offer some interesting findings. They found that the level and share of state and local taxes were influenced in some unexpected ways. {TELs} imposed on state governments had little or no impact on increasing reliance on general tax revenues sources. Where both state and local governments faced limitations, the consequences were greater for local tax structures than for the state. States characterized by local {TELs} did show short-term overall declines in both state and local tax levels; in the long term, however, state taxes increased in those states. In the area of state aid to localities, Joyce and Mullins found a link between {TELs} and increased aid, although the evidence indicates that some increases may be attributed to other forces and trends. Finally, Joyce and Mullins found that with the exception of public welfare expenditures, state-level {TELs} had little impact on the relative amount each government level spent in various functional categories. Where limitations were imposed on both state and local governments, the state was found to be more reluctant to assume increasing burdens. Joyce and Mullins raise a variety of questions addressing the relationship between {TELs} and other forces that influence the structure of state and local revenues and expenditures. They also raise issues regarding the "offsetting" effects of different types of {TELs}, the distribution of state aid, and the impacts of {TELs} on the structure of local governance.},

            Tax and expenditure limits ({TELs}) are restrictions placed on governments limiting their ability to collect and spend revenue. Residents support these {TELs}, as they desire lower tax burdens and more government efficiency; yet, residents still desire the same level of public services. Property tax rate limits, a specific type of {TEL}, are placed upon local governments to limit their ability to collect revenue and expand authority. Rate limits were implemented on the assumption that governments would tax at their highest maximum possible rate, but this is not always the case. This article studies why some local governments choose not to utilize their maximum allotted property tax rate. Using an open systems governance approach, a panel data analysis was conducted using data from 67 Florida counties from 2008 to 2017. Results of the analysis show that the use of special districts and the age of the residential population have significant effects on property tax rate decisions.},

Central to this shift is diminished local control of the property tax, a result of the tax limitations adopted in most states since the 1970s. This article argues that control of the property tax is critical to the workings of local representative democracy, affecting both the discretion of elected officials and participation of citizens. It presents both quantitative and qualitative evidence of the centralization trend, including changes in property-tax flows and state finances affecting local governments, an analysis of the comparative severity of property-tax limitations, changes in K-12 education financing, and local consequences of the tax limitations.},

	abstract = {The world has now experienced what could be regarded as 20 years of Institutional Liberalism: the dominance of the view that cooperation in world politics can be enhanced through the construction and support of multilateral institutions based on liberal principles. E. H. Carr was famously skeptical of liberalism as he understood that tradition. This essay, prepared originally as the E. H. Carr Lecture at Aberystwyth University, interrogates Institutional Liberalism through a lens provided by Carr’s most famous book on international relations, The Twenty Years’ Crisis. It points out three trends since the 1990s that may be associated with Institutional Liberalism: increasing legalization; trends toward more legalism and moralism; and a decline in the coherence of some international regimes. Reviewing these trends in light of Realist critiques of liberalism, the essay rejects Realism as a good moral or practical guide to world politics, but reaffirms the value of the Realist view that institutions depend on structures of power and interests. Increases in legalization, legalism and moralism reflect a fusion of the social purpose of liberal democracies with their unprecedented geopolitical power since 1991. But declines in the coherence of international regimes reflect a greater divergence of interests, weighted by power. All international institutions are flawed and in some ways precarious, but strengthening them in ways that reflect legitimate social purposes remains a major challenge for our time.},

In this highly original study, Sophie Esch approaches political violence through its most direct but also most symbolic tool: the firearm. In novels, songs, and photos of insurgency, firearms appear as artifacts, tropes, and props, through which artists negotiate conceptions of modernity, citizenship, and militancy. Esch grounds her analysis in important rereadings of canonical texts by Martín Luis Guzman, Nellie Campobello, Omar Cabezas, Gioconda Belli, Sergio Ramirez, Horacio Castellanos Moya, and others. Through the lens of the iconic firearm, Esch relates the story of the peasant insurgencies of the Mexican Revolution, the guerrilla warfare of the Sandinista Revolution, and the ongoing drug-related wars in Mexico and Central America, to highlight the historical, cultural, gendered, and political significance of weapons in this volatile region"--},

	title = {Operation Condor, the War on Drugs, and Counterinsurgency in the Golden Triangle (1977–1983)},
	abstract = {In the late 1960s, the Mexican government launched a series of counternarcotics campaigns characterized by the militarization of drug production zones, particularly in the northwestern region—the so-called Golden Triangle, epicenter of both production and trafficking of marijuana and opium poppy since the 1930s. Operations Canador (1969–1975) and Trizo (1976) served as a laboratory for methods to curb drug production, ranging from harassment of drug growers to the aerial defoliation of illicit crops. Operation Condor (1977–1988) combined and enhanced these strategies, wreaking havoc on communities of alleged drug growers, but without entirely disrupting the drug industry. This paper explores the role of the {US} government in the militarization of Mexico’s anti-drug policy, underscoring how the ruling party (the Institutional Revolutionary Party, {PRI}) took advantage of this shift to tackle domestic issues and reassert its hegemony. I argue that Operation Condor functioned as a counterinsurgency campaign oriented to thwart both social and armed movements, eliminate competitors in the narcotics market, and reorganize the drug industry to protect successful drug lords. Operation Condor also caused the decentralization of the drug industry from the northwest and created a new clientelistic pact between drug lords and national security agencies, such as the Federal Security Directorate 
({DFS}), the Office of the Attorney General of Mexico–Federal Judicial Police ({PGR}-{PJF}), and the Secretariat of National Defense ({SEDENA}), which benefited from drug proceeds. Finally, the de facto state of siege imposed in the Golden Triangle produced thousands of victims of harassment, torture, rape, murder, forced-disappearance, and displacement; massive human rights abuses that authorities either concealed or denied.},

Q-sort, Semantic Differential, and other data suggest that low-level users take cocaine to overcome personal insecurities and relieve boredom. Heavy users take it to support overvaulting ambitions and intense strivings for self-sufficiency. Psychotherapy with such persons must deal with their counterdependency, anger, and despair, and with their underlying sense of betrayal. These persons have unacknowledged needs for spiritual experience that must be dealt with openly. A description of persons most vulnerable to heavy use of cocaine is provided, and recommendations for research and social policy are presented.},

In this review article, we explain why and how. Drawing from scholarly, journalistic, and policy sources we identify and theorize the political-economic logics and grounded processes underlying the pervasive nexus of agrarian change, clandestine activities, and illicit capital. We first outline three key elements of the political economic context that create and enable land acquisition by drug traffickers. We then elucidate narcos’ multiple motives for acquiring, transforming, and holding rural landed property. Ultimately, we make a case for understanding drug traffickers as a “narco-bourgeoisie” due to their use of cocaine profits to establish and extend private property relations into erstwhile communal and protected lands that were previously unavailable for capital accumulation. We argue that theorizing drug traffickers in this way better captures the relationship between drug control policy and capitalism, and the role of illicit capital in land use change.},

	abstract = {According to a conventional evolutionary perspective, the human propensity for substance use is the product of a ‘mismatch’ between emotional mechanisms that evolved in a past without pure drugs or direct routes of drug administration, and the occurrence of these phenomena in the contemporary environment. The primary purpose of this review is to assert that, contrary to the conventional view, humans have shared a coevolutionary relationship with psychotropic plant substances that is millions of years old. We argue that this ‘deep time’ relationship is self-evident both in the extant chemical–ecological adaptations that have evolved in mammals to metabolize psychotropic plant substances and in the structure of plant defensive chemicals that have evolved to mimic the structure, and interfere with the function, of mammalian neurotransmitters. Given this evidence, we question how emotional mechanisms easily triggered by plant toxins can have evolved. Our argument is also supported with archeological and historical evidence of substance use in antiquity suggesting that, for people in the past, psychotropic plant substances were as much a mundane everyday item as they are for many people today. Our second, and more speculative objective is to suggest provisional hypotheses of human substance-using phenomena that can incorporate the evolutionary implications of a deep time relationship between psychotropic substances and people. We discuss hypotheses of selective beneﬁts of substance use, including the idea that neurotransmitter-analog plant chemicals were exploited as substitutes for costly, nutritionally constrained endogenous neurotransmitters. However, even if substance seeking was adaptive in the environment of our hominid ancestors, it may not still be so in the contemporary environment. Thus, the implications of our argument are not that the mismatch concept does not apply to human substance-using phenomena, but that it must be reconsidered and extended to incorporate the implications of a substance-rich, rather than substance-free, evolutionary past.},

Uyghurs now are clearly victims of genocidal policies through internment of all types. The total internment of Uyghurs involves physical, psychological and virtual internments. In this article, I discuss the issue in three parts, namely internment camps for Uyghurs, urban internment and virtual internment. While all of them have both physical and psychological aspects, the last two are based on an Orwelian use of surveillance technologies for the purpose of large-scale persecution and suppression of Uyghurs with the intention of achieving a China with one homogenous culture. The total internment which is currently being carried out has two main motives: Islamophobia and the crucial geo-strategical position of the Uyghur homeland.},

	abstract = {The claim that international institutions can transform state interests is central to neoliberal challenges to the realist assumption that "process" (interaction and learning among states) cannot fundamentally affect system "structure" (anarchy and the distribution of capabilities). Systematic development of this claim, however, has been hampered by the neoliberals' commitment to rational choice theory, which treats interests as exogenously given and thus offers only a weak form of institutional analysis. A growing body of international relations scholarship points to ways in which the identities and interests of states are socially constructed by knowledgeable practice. This article builds a bridge between this scholarship and neoliberalism by developing a theory of identity- and interest-formation in support of the neoliberal claim that international institutions can transform state interests. Its substantive focus is the realist view that anarchies are necessarily self-help systems, which justifies disinterest in processes of identity- and interest-formation. Self-help is a function not of anarchy but of process and, as such, is itself an institution that determines the meaning of anarchy and the distribution of power for state action. The article concludes with an examination of how this institution can be transformed by practices of sovereignty, by an evolution of cooperation, and by critical strategic practice.},

	title = {Genetic Fiduciaries, Rethinking Genome Governance},
	abstract = {Exploitative practices permeate the “genetic sphere” of biomedicine and biotechnology. Entities such as genetic testing and biotech companies, laboratories, biobanks, research institutions, and government agencies employ various practices to extract as much value as possible from genetic material and information. Exploitative practices include requiring individuals to waive property rights over genetic material and information; using these resources for purposes other than those for which they were obtained without the individuals’ knowledge or understanding of the implications of such use; or collecting these resources surreptitiously without any significant oversight or accountability. Such practices steer genetic material and information toward the ends of powerful entities while undermining individuals’ property and privacy interests. They result in “appropriative harms.”

Exploitative practices cannot be surmounted within the existing legal framework. This framework is fragmented, excessively narrow, and riddled with inconsistencies. It fails to provide meaningful protection against exploitative practices and does not address the profound power asymmetries between individuals and powerful entities that collect, use, and share genetic material and information. This Article addresses this gap by laying the theoretical and regulatory groundwork for future legal reform. It creates a new statutory category of “genetic fiduciaries,” proposing to impose quasi-fiduciary duties of loyalty and care on every entity in the genetic sphere, whether public or private; enacts a new federal law with broad applicability and scope; and establishes a new federal agency with rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement responsibilities.},

Latin American countries show a mixed picture, confirming the idea that the resource curse is not a deterministic phenomenon and that dependence on, rather than abundance of, natural resources is associated with developmental failures. When looking beyond the nation state, local communities may benefit from royalties accruing to regional governments, often, though, at the expense of other socioeconomic liabilities (as in the case of negative environmental externalities). The case of Ecuador is in many ways exemplary of the resource curse in Latin America and the failure of policies to overcome the curse. While the country was always a commodity exporter, the intensification of extractive activities and the expansion of the extractive frontier (over the last five decades) intensified the severity of boom-and-bust cycles and compromised socio-environmental values in the vicinity of extractive activity.},

Statistical models that estimate the spatial locations of individual decision-makers have made a key contribution to this success. Spatial models have been estimated for the U.S. Congress, the Supreme Court, U.S. presidents, a large number of non-U.S. legislatures, and supranational organizations. Yet one potentially fruitful laboratory for testing spatial theories, the individual U.S. states, has remained relatively unexploited, for two reasons. First, state legislative roll call data have not yet been systematically collected for all states over time. Second, because ideal point models are based on latent scales, comparisons of ideal points across states or even between chambers within a state are difficult. This article reports substantial progress on both fronts. First, we have obtained the roll call voting data for all state legislatures from the mid-1990s onward. Second, we exploit a recurring survey of state legislative candidates to allow comparisons across time, chambers, states as well as with the U.S. Congress. The resulting mapping of America's state legislatures has great potential to address numerous questions not only about state politics and policymaking, but also about legislative politics in general.},

For each type of network, fully replicable code is presented first for small toy examples, then for complete empirical examples using transportation, political, and social networks.

It highlights Mariátegui’s understanding of race, power, and identity; the combined and uneven development of capital; and the role of myth and voluntarism in revolutionary struggle as key points in which the early-twentieth-century Peruvian contributes to contemporary debates in Marxist praxis in Latin America and beyond.},

The emergence of a threat to peasant subsistence is emphasized as a key factor, especially when the peasantry puts the blame in good part upon unjust or neglectful government policies. Questions of agrarian structure, geopolitics, guerrilla organization, and official repressive capacity are also analyzed. Since Sendero Luminoso is the first major rural revolutionary movement to have emerged after a sweeping agrarian reform, the author examines this anomalous circumstance.},

Recent changes in Congress point to the polarization of women, where Democratic women remain more liberal than Democratic men but Republican women are no different from, or more conservative than, Republican men. We use newly available state legislative roll-call data to determine whether women state legislators are more liberal or polarized than male copartisans. We find that while Democratic women state legislators remain consistently more liberal than male copartisans in most state chambers, Republican women legislators are growing more conservative. Thus, women state legislators are increasingly polarized in most U.S. states. Legislator replacement and increasing polarization among state legislators in office contribute to this effect. We argue that polarization among women legislators has implications for the representation of women in the states.},

Recent methodological innovations in the analysis of roll-call data have produced a number of important theoretical insights, such as understanding the structure of congressional decisionmaking and the role of parties and ideology in Congress. Many of the methodological innovations and theoretical questions sparked by congressional scholarship have been difficult to test at the state level because of the lack of comprehensive data on various forms of state legislative behavior, including roll-call voting. The Representation in Americas Legislatures project rectifies that problem through collection of comprehensive state legislative roll-call votes across all 99 state legislative chambers for the 1999-2000 and 2003-04 legislative sessions. In this article, we describe the data available through this project as well as our data acquisition procedures, including Stata and Perl programming and {OCR} of paper documents, with suggestions about how to use these methods to collect a wide range of state-level data.},

We conduct Monte Carlo simulations altering assumptions regarding the dimensionality and distribution of member preferences and scale the resulting roll call matrices. Our simulations show that party polarization generates misleading evidence in favor of low dimensionality. This suggests that the increasing levels of party polarization in recent Congresses may have produced false evidence in favor of a low-dimensional policy space. However, we show that focusing more narrowly on each party caucus in isolation can help researchers discern the true dimensionality of the policy space in the context of significant party polarization. We re-examine the historical roll call record and find evidence suggesting that the low dimensionality of the contemporary Congress may reflect party polarization rather than changes in the dimensionality of policy conflict.},

	abstract = {Objective. Research has established that female legislators act differently than their male counterparts in state legislatures. But the effect of gender on roll call voting is less clear, due in part to the fact that research has not properly differentiated between the multiple ways gender can influence roll call voting. Methods. In order to better understand the relationship between gender and roll call voting, structural equation modeling is used to examine roll call voting in numerous issue areas in five state legislatures. Results. Gender rarely exerts a direct influence on roll call voting. Instead, the influence of gender is manifested through ideology and party. Conclusion. The primary effect of gender on roll call voting is that it leads female legislators to make different choices in ideology and partisanship as compared to their male counterparts.},

The results suggest that, although party and ideology both influence voting, the impact of party is greater. The magnitude of this impact varies, however, from chamber to chamber. The activity of parties in the electoral arena explains part of this variance, with more active parties having more influence. Thus, research on legislative behavior should focus on the context surrounding the decision-making process in order for us to understand the influences on voting.},

It examines the evolution of civil society and the constitution of the discursive field in which it has been defined, to explain how and to what limit the different discourses legitimise and enable the understanding of the plurality of actors as well as their potential for action and influence in the political processes. The analysis is divided into two stages: the founding phase (the 1990s) that begins with the arrival of the Special Period; and the consolidation stage, which starts with the new century, in particular since 2007 with the ‘updating model’ that has begun to push deeper changes. This periodisation, in stages that are associated with different state strategies, seeks a comparison to assess the impacts of each of the challenges and proposals facing civil society.},

China and Cuba resumed their comradeship after Castro endorsed China's crackdown of the 1989 pro-democracy movement, and since then Beijing has promoted its approach towards legitimizing the one-party regime through engaging in economic reforms and opening to the world to Havana. "China's lesson for Cuba" has been discussed by many Cubanists worldwide. However, the Chinese approach has posed a dilemma to Fidel Castro: he admires China's power but has doubts about the future of socialism in China. The article argues that Castro has so far adopted his old strategy for dealing with Soviet influence in the 1960s in his engagement with China: praising his political ally's power as the evidence of socialism's vitality for his domestic consumption, while significantly limiting the application of China's economic policies. But his more pragmatic successors, Raul Castro in particular, may adopt the Chinese approach.},

	abstract = {In the debate over the role of civil society under authoritarian regimes, the spread of transnational web-based media obliges us to rethink the arenas in which the societal voice can be raised - and heard. Taking the case of state-socialist Cuba, a diachronic comparison analyzes civil society dynamics prior to the Internet - in the early to mid-1990s, and a decade later, after digital and web-based media made their way onto the island. The study finds that in the pre-Internet period, the focus was on behind-the-scenes struggles for associational autonomy within the state-socialist framework. A decade later, web-based communication technologies have supported the emergence of a new type of public sphere in which the civil society debate is marked by autonomous citizen action. While this defies the socialist regime’s design of state-society relations, its effect on democratization depends on the extent to which a web-based voice connects with off-line public debate and social action.},

Certainly, from a social science perspective, the future of Cuba after Fidel Castro is open. On the other hand, different, often mutually inconsistent scenarios for regime transition suggest that Cuba's future is over-determined. Both features of social reality — openness and over-determination — create space for visions, ideologies, strategies, and other normative interventions designed to impose a particular cognitive and political order on social reality. While social science should try to include such ‘subjective factors’ in its objective account, it must maintain a critical distance from the normative closure and hopeful predictions that ideologies and strategies of necessity imply. Based on an analytical distinction between relatively stable systems and rapidly changing systems, this paper identifies and goes on to discuss the major systems of primary relevance for Cuba's future.},

Agent-oriented hypotheses focusing on soft-liners and opposition groups better explain the Cuban nontransition than structural factors such as socioeconomic development, economic crisis, and the international environment.

	abstract = {The survival of socialism in Cuba eight years after the collapse of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe has come as a surprise to many observers. This analysis surveys Cuba’s current economic, political and social conditions, discusses regime stability and reform pressures in light of the Eastern European experience, and identifies the major processes and sources of social change. The same factors that account for the survival of the regime—charismatic leadership and the fusion of nationalism and socialism, reinforced by a confrontationist {US} foreign policy—open a window of opportunity for an approach to fundamental reform that could avoid the costs of both neoliberal radicalism and political immobilism. The analysis concludes by sketching the main elements of such an alternative reform strategy.},

This article summarizes and then assesses Cardoso’s argument about the choice of paths faced by Latin American countries, the consequences for democracy and development of following different paths, and the political position that is supported by this analysis of choices and their consequences. Though Cardoso explicitly supports the path of globalized social democracy over an anti-globalization option in the current period, I suggest that the current state of knowledge does not offer unequivocal support for the argument that choosing to follow the path of globalized social democracy—or that of anti-globalization—is the best political option for all countries in Latin America. Different countries might very well be doing what is best for them, given their circumstances, by following different paths.},

Populists are charismatic leaders who use a fiery rhetoric to pitch the interests of “the people” against those of banks, large firms, multinational companies, the International Monetary Fund, and immigrants. Populists implement redistributive policies that violate the basic laws of economics, and in particular budget constraints. Most populist experiments go through five distinct phases that span from euphoria to collapse. Historically, the vast majority of populist episodes end up badly; incomes of the poor and middle class tend to be lower than when the experiment was launched. I argue that many of the characteristics of traditional Latin American populism are present in more recent manifestations from around the globe.},

	abstract = {Social media recommender systems play a central role in determining what content is seen online, and what remains hidden. As a point of control for media governance, they are subject to intense controversy and, increasingly, regulation by European policymakers. A recurring theme in such efforts is transparency, but this is an ambiguous concept that can be implemented in various ways depending on the types of accountability one envisages. This paper maps and critiques the various efforts at regulating social media recommendation transparency in Europe, and the types of accountability they pursue. This paper identifies three different categories of disclosure rules in recent policymaking: (1) user-facing disclaimers, (2) government auditing and (3) data-sharing partnerships with academia and civil society.  Despite their limitations and pitfalls, it is argued, each of these approaches has a potential added value for media governance as part of a tiered, variegated landscape of transparency rules. However, an important element is missing: public disclosures. Given the deeply political and value-laden context of media governance, it is argued, this field cannot rely exclusively on technocratic, institutionalized forms of transparency emphasized in current proposals. The final section articulates the distinct benefits of public disclosures as a supplement to existing transparency measures, and suggests starting points for their design and regulation.{NOW} {AVAILABLE} {IN} {OPEN} {ACCESS} {AT} {THE} {EUROPEAN} {JOURNAL} {OF} {LAW} {AND} {TECHNOLOGY}: https://ejlt.org/index.php/ejlt/article/view/786},

	abstract = {Automated audits of recommender systems found that blindly following recommendations leads users to increasingly partisan, conspiratorial, or false content. At the same time, studies using real user traces suggest that recommender systems are not the primary driver of attention toward extreme content; on the contrary, such content is mostly reached through other means, e.g., other websites. In this paper, we explain the following apparent paradox: if the recommendation algorithm favors extreme content, why is it not driving its consumption? With a simple agent-based model where users attribute different utilities to items in the recommender system, we show that the collaborative-filtering nature of recommender systems and the nicheness of extreme content can resolve the apparent paradox: although blindly following recommendations would indeed lead users to niche content, users rarely consume niche content when given the option because it is of low utility to them, which can lead the recommender system to deamplify such content. Our results call for a nuanced interpretation of ``algorithmic amplification'' and highlight the importance of modeling the utility of content to users when auditing recommender systems.},

Starting from the same kind of data we propose an alternative, discrete, representation that replaces positions (points and distances) with niches (boxes and overlap). In the one-dimensional case, this corresponds to replacing the left-to-right ordering of points on the real line with an interval order. As it turns out, this seemingly simplistic one-dimensional model is sufficient to represent the similarity of roll-call votes by U.S. senators in recent years. In a historic context, however, low dimensionality represents the exception which stands in contrast to what is suggested by scaling techniques.},

	title = {The Ten Most Important Section 230 Rulings},
	volume = {20},
	abstract = {In 1996, Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a major statutory reform of the telecommunications industry. The act included the Communications Decency Act ({CDA}), Congress’ first (and unconstitutional) regulation of the Internet. The {CDA} principally criminalized online pornography, but it also included 47 U.S.C. § 230 (Section 230), which says that websites aren’t legally responsible for third party content.

While somewhat overshadowed at the time by the Telecommunications Act and the {CDA}’s criminal provisions, Section 230 has emerged as one of Congress’ most important accomplishments of the 1990s. Section 230 has been described as “the law that gave us the modern Internet,” the “most important law in tech,” and “the law that makes the Internet go.” All of the top 10 most-trafficked websites (as ranked by Alexa) republish third party content, and nine of those sites depend on Section 230 to do so. In effect, Section 230 provides the legal foundation for the Internet we know and love the most.

Since its passage, Section 230 has been litigated hundreds of times. This jurisprudence has profoundly impacted the law’s scope and reach — and has sparked intense policy discussions, including recently introduced Congressional bills seeking to reverse one of the cases discussed below (Doe v. Backpage).

A review of the most important Section 230 cases tells a story about how the case law has built such an important yet controversial immunity. This essay takes that journey by rank-ordering the top Section 230 cases of the past two decades.},

	abstract = {Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which immunizes online service providers from liability for user content, is key to the business models of some of the nation’s largest online platforms. For two decades, the 1996 statute was mostly unknown outside of technology law circles. This has changed in recent years, as large social media companies have played an increasingly central role in American life and have thus faced unprecedented scrutiny for their decisions to allow or remove controversial user content. Section 230 has entered the national spotlight as a topic of national media coverage, congressional hearings, and presidential campaign rallies. Unfortunately, not all this attention has accurately portrayed why Congress passed § 230 or how the statute works. The misunderstandings of the law are particularly troubling as Congress is considering dozens of proposals to amend or repeal it. This Article attempts to set the record straight and provide a “user’s guide” to the statute, along with principles for legislators to consider as they evaluate amendments to this vital law.},

	abstract = {The {EU}’s General Data Protection Regulation ({GDPR}) went into effect in May 2018, impacting companies, individuals, and countries around the world. The {GDPR} is long and notoriously complex. A number of helpful and influential practical overviews exist. None of these overviews, however, has squarely taken aim at what we understand to be the most significant hurdles for U.S.-based readers. Understanding the {GDPR} requires knowing not only what it contains, but how to read it,and a basic understanding of both data protection and broader European law. We aim in this Essay to provide a concise one-stop-shop for {GDPR} novices, dabblers, and would-be experts in the U.S. that includes both necessary background context and pointers to reliable resources. We endeavor, too, to correct common misconceptions about the {GDPR}: that it is founded on individual consent (it’s not); that it’s about privacy (it’s about data protection); and that it’s primarily about individual rights and control (it’s equally about risk management and corporate compliance). We hope to thus inform legal practice, legal scholarship, and ongoing policy conversations about the enactment of data privacy law in the United States.},

	shorttitle = {Distinguishing Privacy Law},
	abstract = {What distinguishes violations of privacy from other harms? This has proven a surprisingly difficult question to answer. For over a century, privacy law scholars labored to define the illusive concept of privacy. Then they gave up. Efforts at distinguishing privacy came to be superseded at the turn of the millennium by a new approach: a taxonomy of privacy problems grounded in social recognition. Privacy law became the field that simply studies whatever courts or scholars talk about as related to privacy. And it worked. Decades into privacy as social taxonomy, the field has expanded to encompass a broad range of information-based harms—from consumer manipulation to algorithmic bias—generating many, rich insights. Yet the approach has come at a cost. This article diagnoses the pathologies of a field that has abandoned defining its core subject matter, and offers a research agenda for privacy in the aftermath of social recognition. This critique is overdue: it is past time to think anew about exactly what work the concept of privacy is doing in a complex information environment, and why a given societal problem—from discrimination to misinformation—is worthy of study under a privacy framework. Only then can privacy scholars articulate what we are expert in and participate meaningfully in global policy discussions about how to govern information-based harms.},

While ideas were not the primary cause of neoliberal reform, their development, articulation, and dissemination are a significant part of the story of the rise and fall of the “Washington Consensus.” The neoliberalism of the 1980s and 1990s lost credibility and capacity to provide politically feasible policy guidelines because it was based on an elitist, exclusionary pact among small groups of experts and elites representing the interests of transnational capital. Only by understanding the origins and limitations of the ideas behind neoliberal reform can a new, more inclusive economic model for Latin America be created.},

This contribution discusses the determinants of domestic policy choices that affect inequality and the consequences of these policy choices. The empirical focus is on Latin American countries, which collectively are characterized by the highest regional levels of inequality in the world, but individually show considerable variation. Different analyses have emphasized different causes of income inequality and of the variation in inequality, such as historical structural roots in land distribution and natural-resource endowments, geography, ethnic divisions, the economic context, demographics, and state action or lack thereof. The role of the state has not received much systematic attention until rather recently, though, despite its essential role in the allocation of resources.},

Pursuing reliable supporters appears to be increasingly desirable for political campaigns, especially since 2000, relative to the risky and uncertain prospects of targeting less reliable supporters. I speculate this shift is attributable, at least in part, to changes in the context in which contemporary campaigns operate, coinciding with the 2000 presidential election; advances in microtargeting, particularly through new e-campaigning and e-mobilization technologies, and behavioral science related to voter mobilization represent two of the most potent developments. By contrast, persuasion is a far more difficult and risky approach. I conclude that growing emphasis on base mobilization in elections has likely contributed to intensifying partisan polarization in America.},

	abstract = {Contemporary political ills at the mass behavior level (e.g., outgroup aggression, conspiracy theories) are often attributed to increasing polarization and partisan tribalism. We theorize that many such problems are less the product of left-right orientations than an orthogonal “anti-establishment” dimension of opinion dominated by conspiracy, populist, and Manichean orientations. Using two national surveys from 2019 and 2020, we find that this dimension of opinion is correlated with several antisocial psychological traits, the acceptance of political violence, and time spent on extremist social media platforms. It is also related to support for populist candidates, such as Trump and Sanders, and beliefs in misinformation and conspiracy theories. While many inherently view politics as a conflict between left and right, others see it as a battle between “the people” and a corrupt establishment. Our findings demonstrate an urgent need to expand the traditional conceptualization of mass opinion beyond familiar left-right identities and affective orientations.},

We argue that the best estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans’ candidates choices in general elections is zero. First, a systematic meta-analysis of 40 ﬁeld experiments estimates an average effect of zero in general elections. Second, we present nine original ﬁeld experiments that increase the statistical evidence in the literature about the persuasive effects of personal contact 10-fold. These experiments’ average effect is also zero. In both existing and our original experiments, persuasive effects only appear to emerge in two rare circumstances. First, when candidates take unusually unpopular positions and campaigns invest unusually heavily in identifying persuadable voters. Second, when campaigns contact voters long before election day and measure effects immediately—although this early persuasion decays. These ﬁndings contribute to ongoing debates about how political elites inﬂuence citizens’ judgments.},

This textbook is a practical introduction to data analysis and statistics written especially for undergraduates and beginning graduate students in the social sciences and allied fields, such as economics, sociology, public policy, and data science. Quantitative Social Science engages directly with empirical analysis, showing students how to analyze data using the R programming language and to interpret the results--it encourages hands-on learning, not paper-and-pencil statistics. More than forty data sets taken directly from leading quantitative social science research illustrate how data analysis can be used to answer important questions about society and human behavior. Proven in the classroom, this one-of-a-kind textbook features numerous additional data analysis exercises and interactive R programming exercises, and also comes with supplementary teaching materials for instructors. --},

	abstract = {This article reexamines the argument that targeted programs increase pro-incumbent voting by persuading beneficiaries to cast ballots against their first partisan choice. The evidence comes from the randomized component of Progresa, the pioneering Mexican conditional cash transfer ({CCT}) program. Experimental data show that early enrollment in the program led to substantive increases in voter turnout and in the incumbent’s vote share in the 2000 presidential election. The experiment also reveals that opposition parties’ vote shares were unaffected by the program. Thus, the electoral bonus generated by {CCTs} may be best explained by a mobilizing rather than persuasive mechanism. These findings are difficult to reconcile with the notion that the electoral effects of {CCTs} are a result of prospective concerns triggered by threats of program discontinuation or endogenous program enrollment. Instead, the evidence in this article suggests that {CCTs}’ mobilizing effects are compatible with programmatic politics.},

Or are there fundamental reasons why modern presidents fail to deliver, time and time again? In The Impossible Presidency, historian Jeremi Suri charts the long rise and quick fall of the world's most important job, from the 1790s to the present day. As he shows, early presidents greatly expanded the power of the office beyond the limited role envisioned by the founders. Suri argues that the immense accomplishments of Washington, Jackson, Lincoln and {FDR} left their successors with outsized and unrealistic expectations. John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan lost control of their agendas as they were buffeted by the onrush of events and threats their predecessors never had to face. Clinton and Obama were propelled to the presidency by their personal stories but hamstrung by prurient, partisan, and prejudiced criticisms of their leadership. Contemporary presidents must react to a truly globalized world and a rapid twenty-four-our news cycle. There is little room left for bold, strategic thinking. Suri traces our disenchantment with recent presidents to the current mismatch between presidential promises and the limitations of the office},

	shorttitle = {Last Stand for Prudential Standing?},
	abstract = {In Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., the Su­ preme Court called into question its “prudential standing” doctrine, a set of self-imposed limits “beyond the constitutional requirements” of Article {III} that have been “in some tension” with the Court’s “virtually unﬂagging” obligation to hear any case or controversy that satisﬁes the requirements of Article {III}. To ameliorate this tension, the Court in Lexmark reclassiﬁed two of the three types of prudential standing restrictions it had previously categorized under that rubric. Notably, however, the Court did not say how third-party prudential standing ﬁts into the picture, instead leaving that question for “another day.” Courts and commentators since then have acknowledged that Lexmark essen­ tially heralded the end of this rule as well, at least in its current form. In Starr International, a recent case before the Federal Circuit, that court applied the third-party prudential standing rule despite acknowledging that the plaintiff had satisﬁed Article {III}’s requirements. A pending certiorari petition in that case asks the Court to reverse the Federal Circuit and resolve this lingering issue leftover from Lexmark. Whether or not the Court grants certiorari in Starr International, at some point the Court will need to resolve the issue left open in Lexmark, and when it does this will probably mark the end of prudential standing as we know it. Additionally, if (or when) the Court abrogates prudential standing, it likely will have ripple effects on other self-imposed prudential limitations, as well as other doctrines without clear footing in Article {III}.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00074},
	abstract = {If popular online platforms systematically expose their users to partisan and unreliable news, they could potentially contribute to societal issues like rising political polarization. This concern is central to the echo chamber and filter bubble debates, which critique the roles that user choice and algorithmic curation play in guiding users to different online information sources. These roles can be measured in terms of exposure, the {URLs} seen while using an online platform, and engagement, the {URLs} selected while on that platform or browsing the web more generally. However, due to the challenges of obtaining ecologically valid exposure data--what real users saw during their regular platform use--studies in this vein often only examine engagement data, or estimate exposure via simulated behavior or inference. Despite their centrality to the contemporary information ecosystem, few such studies have focused on web search, and even fewer have examined both exposure and engagement on any platform. To address these gaps, we conducted a two-wave study pairing surveys with ecologically valid measures of exposure and engagement on Google Search during the 2018 and 2020 {US} elections. We found that participants' partisan identification had a small and inconsistent relationship with the amount of partisan and unreliable news they were exposed to on Google Search, a more consistent relationship with the search results they chose to follow, and the most consistent relationship with their overall engagement. That is, compared to the news sources our participants were exposed to on Google Search, we found more identity-congruent and unreliable news sources in their engagement choices, both within Google Search and overall. These results suggest that exposure and engagement with partisan or unreliable news on Google Search are not primarily driven by algorithmic curation, but by users' own choices.},

	doi = {10.2139/ssrn.3462697},
	abstract = {This Essay, a precursor to a larger project, uses Rucho v. Common Cause, to argue that there are two different normative conception of politics in the Court's law and politics jurisprudence.  For the conservative Justices on the Court, politics is sordid, partisan, and unfair. Law and politics cases, specifically political-gerrymandering claims, ask the Court to perform a task that courts are ill-equipped to perform, which is to clean up a process that is inherently dirty and to make fair a process that is inherently partial. Rucho, representing the Court's law and politics cases more broadly, is both an affirmation of a traditional conception of politics and also a rejection of a more modern conception that is beginning to find a foothold in American politics — with roots in the Court’s malapportionment jurisprudence — about how representative democratic institutions ought to operate. This more modern approach reflects the beliefs that representative electoral structures and American politics more generally ought to include some basic notion of fairness; a commitment to the public good without the hindrance of partisanship; and a conception of fair play that constrains the behavior of those who design electoral structures. In contrast to the majority in Rucho, proponents of the modern conception envision a role for the Court in enforcing basic rules of fairness and fair play while at the same time indirectly promoting a particular vision of the public good that is not filtered through partisan identity in the design of structures of representation. In order to understand the division in Rucho, why the plaintiffs in Rucho failed to win over the conservatives on the Court, and the Court's law and politics cases more broadly, we have to come to terms with these different worldviews on the Court. Is sordid politics an inherently necessary and arguably normatively good part of the political process, and thus a necessary part of our representative institutions? Relatedly, do substantive fairness principles exist — outside of race and the equal-population principle — that constrain political actors when they design electoral structures to favor themselves at the expense of their opponents? This essay explores those issues.},

We report an insignificant intent-to-treat effect of political ads on turnout (2.3 pp.), but we cannot rule out a sizable positive effect, with 95\% confidence interval of [-2.8,7.4]. The result may mask important heterogeneity, with political ads making Democrats slightly more motivated to vote and Republicans – substantially less. We explore the reasons for this effect, such as natural variation in ad content: the majority of Facebook ads on users’ feeds skewed Democratic. Lastly, the effect on measures of affective polarization and informedness was negligible.},

Building on insights from our qualitative data and previous scholarship on algorithms and identity, we propose a novel conceptual model to understand how people think about and interact with personalized algorithmic systems. Drawing on the metaphor of crystals and their properties, the algorithmic crystal framework is an analytic frame that captures user understandings of how personalized algorithms (1) interact with user identity by reflecting user self-concepts that are both multifaceted and dynamic and (2) shape perspectives on others encountered through the algorithm, by orienting users to recognize parts of themselves refracted in other users and to experience ephemeral, diffracted connections with groups of similar others. We describe how the algorithmic crystal framework can extend theory and inform new lines of research around the implications of algorithms in self-concept development and social life.},

	doi = {10.31228/osf.io/fbvxd},
	abstract = {Interoperability is a technical mechanism for computing systems to work together – even if they are from competing firms. An interoperability requirement for large online platforms has been suggested by the European Commission as one ex ante (up-front rule) mechanism in its proposed Digital Markets Act ({DMA}), as a way to encourage competition. The policy goal is to increase choice and quality for users, and the ability of competitors to succeed with better services. The application would be to the largest online platforms, such as Facebook (social media and instant messaging), Google (search and Android), Amazon (marketplace), Apple ({iOS}), and operating system ancillary services, such as payment and app stores. 
This report analyses up-front interoperability requirements as a pro-competition policy tool for regulating large online platforms, exploring the economic and social rationales and possible regulatory mechanisms. It is based on a synthesis of recent comprehensive policy reviews of digital competition in major industrialised economies, and related academic literature, focusing on areas of emerging consensus while noting important disagreements. It draws particularly on the Vestager, Furman and Stigler reviews, and the {UK} Competition and Markets Authority’s study on online platforms and digital advertising. It also draws on interviews with software developers, platform operators, government officials, and civil society experts working in this field.},

They should get at least the level of careful review and negotiation that the {DMCA} did back in 1998: a lot of meetings, among a lot of stakeholders, putting in enough time to truly hash out questions of operational detail for those harmed by online content, users accused of breaking the law, and platforms. We seem less able to have careful discussion now than we were back then. But we should be much better equipped to do it. Today we have not only a broad cadre of academic and civil society experts in intermediary liability -- many of whom signed onto these Seven Principles on point -- but also an entire field of professionals who work on content moderation or on “trust and safety” more broadly.

It answers important questions about limitations on such injunctions under the {eCommerce} Directive (Directive 2000/31/{EC}). But, as this Opinion explains, it leaves some much thornier questions unresolved.Glawischnig-Piesczek holds that courts may, consistent with Art. 15 of the {eCommerce} Directive, require platforms to monitor for and remove specific content. Monitoring orders may not, however, require platforms to carry out an ‘independent assessment’ of the content. The ruling does not closely examine what kinds of injunctions or filtering technologies are permissible, nor does it explore fundamental rights considerations when courts are asked to order platforms to monitor their users. This Opinion lays out the case’s technological, legal, and policy backdrop, and identifies important questions it leaves open for Member State courts. In particular, the Opinion suggests that Glawischnig-Piesczek’s limitation on ‘independent assessment’ will make it difficult for courts to devise injunctions that simultaneously follow the {CJEU}’s guidance under the {eCommerce} Directive and meet the requirements of fundamental rights. It lists key fundamental rights considerations for future cases involving potential monitoring injunctions, including procedural considerations in cases affecting the rights of absent third parties.},

	abstract = {Internet payment blockades are the fruits of a long-term, evolving strategy on the part of corporate copyright and trademark owners to leave no intermediary behind when it comes to online intellectual property enforcement. Where judicial and legislative efforts failed to yield any binding public law requiring payment processors like {MasterCard} and Visa to act as intellectual property enforcers, “non-regulatory” intervention from the executive branch secured their cooperation as a matter of private ordering. The resulting voluntary best practices agreement prescribes a notice-and-termination protocol that extends the reach of U.S. intellectual property law into cyberspace, to merchants operating websites from servers and physical facilities located abroad. It also removes adjudications of infringement claims from the courts to the private sector, which raises issues of fairness and institutional competence. Like other forms of regulation by online intermediaries, payment blockades can be circumvented with the aid of disintermediating technologies. True to the Internet’s founding purpose of redirecting data flows around blocked or damaged channels, P2P virtual currencies like Bitcoin are empowering online merchants and their customers, at least for the time being, to run payment blockades.},

If the First Amendment mirrors Section 230’s speech protections, narrowing Section 230 would be inconsequential. This Essay explains why that’s not the case. Section 230 provides defendants with more substantive and procedural benefits than the First Amendment does. Because the First Amendment does not backfill these benefits, reductions to Section 230’s scope pose serious risks to Internet speech.},

	abstract = {The ease with which copyright-protected material—including books, movies, music, photos, software, and video games—can be copied and shared online across jurisdictional borders makes it challenging for rightsholders to protect their works online as they do offline. Intellectual property rules are territorial, while the Internet is not. In response to this, a growing number of countries are allowing rightsholders to get Internet Service Providers ({ISPs}) to block access to websites involved in the large-scale distribution of pirated material as these sites are typically based in foreign jurisdictions with weak/non-existent intellectual property rules and enforcement (there would be other legal remedies if these services were hosted domestically). Studies show that blocking regimes that target these large scale piracy sites (not sites that accidentally host pirated material) are an effective tool in reducing piracy and increasing the consumption of legal content and services. While website blocking was never going to be the silver bullet to solve piracy online, this was never the goal, merely that it be one of the many tools in the toolbox that countries can use to fight piracy and improve the market for legal content online. To show that it should be part of more countries’ anti-piracy toolbox, including the United States, this post provides an update on various countries’ efforts to use website blocking to fight online piracy.},

The {GDPR} introduces new notice-andtakedown rules for “Right to Be Forgotten” requests that will make deliberate or accidental over-removal of online information far too likely. The new rules give private Internet platforms powerful incentives to erase or delist user-generated content—whether or not that content, or the intermediaries’ processing of the content, actually violates the law. These problems could be mitigated, without threatening the important privacy protections established by the {GDPR}, through procedural checks and balances in the platforms’ removal operations.},

Brendan is a professor of government at Dartmouth College, who has just co-authored a report with the Anti-Defamation League on “Exposure to Alternative and Extremist Content on {YouTube}.” There’s a common conception that {YouTube} acts as a radicalization engine, pushing viewers from mainstream content to increasingly radical material. But Brendan and his coauthors found a somewhat different story: {YouTube} may not funnel all viewers toward extreme content, but it does reliably recommend that content to users who are already viewing it. They discussed his findings and how we should understand the role that {YouTube} plays in the information ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Although it is under-studied relative to other social media platforms, {YouTube} is arguably the largest and most engaging online media consumption platform in the world. Recently, {YouTube}’s scale has fueled concerns that {YouTube} users are being radicalized via a combination of biased recommendations and ostensibly apolitical “anti-woke” channels, both of which have been claimed to direct attention to radical political content. Here we test this hypothesis using a representative panel of more than 300,000 Americans and their individual-level browsing behavior, on and off {YouTube}, from January 2016 through December 2019. Using a labeled set of political news channels, we find that news consumption on {YouTube} is dominated by mainstream and largely centrist sources. Consumers of far-right content, while more engaged than average, represent a small and stable percentage of news consumers. However, consumption of “anti-woke” content, defined in terms of its opposition to progressive intellectual and political agendas, grew steadily in popularity and is correlated with consumption of far-right content off-platform. We find no evidence that engagement with far-right content is caused by {YouTube} recommendations systematically, nor do we find clear evidence that anti-woke channels serve as a gateway to the far right. Rather, consumption of political content on {YouTube} appears to reflect individual preferences that extend across the web as a whole.},

Yet, there is to date no substantial quantitative evidence of this alleged pipeline. To close this gap, we conduct a large-scale audit of user radicalization on {YouTube}. We analyze 330,925 videos posted on 349 channels, which we broadly classified into four types: Media, the Alt-lite, the Intellectual Dark Web (I.D.W.), and the Alt-right. According to the aforementioned radicalization hypothesis, channels in the I.D.W. and the Alt-lite serve as gateways to fringe far-right ideology, here represented by Alt-right channels. Processing 72M+ comments, we show that the three channel types indeed increasingly share the same user base; that users consistently migrate from milder to more extreme content; and that a large percentage of users who consume Alt-right content now consumed Alt-lite and I.D.W. content in the past. We also probe {YouTube}'s recommendation algorithm, looking at more than 2M video and channel recommendations between May/July 2019. We find that Alt-lite content is easily reachable from I.D.W. channels, while Alt-right videos are reachable only through channel recommendations. Overall, we paint a comprehensive picture of user radicalization on {YouTube}.},

	abstract = {In recent years, artificial intelligence has been deployed by online platforms to prevent the upload of allegedly illegal content or to remove unwarranted expressions. These systems are trained to spot objectionable content and to remove it, block it, or filter it out before it is even uploaded. Artificial intelligence filters offer a robust approach to content moderation which is shaping the public sphere. This dramatic shift in norm setting and law enforcement is potentially game-changing for democracy. Artificial intelligence filters carry censorial power, which could bypass traditional checks and balances secured by law. Their opaque and dynamic nature creates barriers to oversight, and conceals critical value choices and tradeoffs. Currently, we lack adequate tools to hold them accountable. This paper seeks to address this gap by introducing an adversarial procedure— – Contesting Algorithms. It proposes to deliberately introduce friction into the dominant removal systems governed by artificial intelligence. Algorithmic content moderation often seeks to optimize a single goal, such as removing copyright-infringing materials or blocking hate speech, while other values in the public interest, such as fair use or free speech, are often neglected. Contesting algorithms introduce an adversarial design which reflects conflicting values, and thereby may offer a check on dominant removal systems. Facilitating an adversarial intervention may promote democratic principles by keeping society in the loop. An adversarial public artificial intelligence system could enhance dynamic transparency, facilitate an alternative public articulation of social values using machine learning systems, and restore societal power to deliberate and determine social tradeoffs.},

	title = {The Constitutionality of Mandating Editorial Transparency},
	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4005647},
	abstract = {Federal and state regulators around the country have made it a high priority to “fix” user-generated content ({UGC}) on the Internet. Many regulators would simply prefer to tell Internet services  what {UGC} they must, can, or cannot publish. However, that option isn’t constitutional; plus, there’s a deep partisan divide over what content should be published online. To bypass these obstacles, requiring Internet services to provide more “transparency” has emerged as an attractive plan B for regulators. For example, in 2021, Florida and Texas imposed wide-ranging disclosure obligations on “social media platforms.” Mandatory transparency laws are generally popular, and they are widely viewed as less Constitutionally problematic than outright censorship. After all, mandatory disclosure laws are prevalent in our society, and they often survive constitutional scrutiny. This Article explores the underappreciated Constitutional problems that arise when regulators compel Internet services to disclose information about their editorial operations and decisions (what the Article calls “mandatory editorial transparency”). In particular, this Article highlights the inevitable problems caused by regulators’ attempts to confirm the accuracy of Internet services’ disclosures. The prospect of such enforcements will motivate Internet services to change their decisions to please regulators—thus having the same effect on speech as more direct, and obviously unconstitutional, speech regulations. This makes mandatory editorial transparency regulations another policy dead-end in regulators’ quest to control online speech.},

	shorttitle = {The New Governors},
	abstract = {Private online platforms have an increasingly essential role in free speech and participation in democratic culture. But while it might appear that any internet user can publish freely and instantly online, many platforms actively curate the content posted by their users. How and why these platforms operate to moderate speech is largely opaque.

This Article provides the first analysis of what these platforms are actually doing to moderate online speech under a regulatory and First Amendment framework. Drawing from original interviews, archived materials, and internal documents, this Article describes how three major online platforms — Facebook, Twitter, and {YouTube} — moderate content and situates their moderation systems into a broader discussion of online governance and the evolution of free expression values in the private sphere. It reveals that private content-moderation systems curate user content with an eye to American free speech norms, corporate responsibility, and the economic necessity of creating an environment that reflects the expectations of their users. In order to accomplish this, platforms have developed a detailed system rooted in the American legal system with regularly revised rules, trained human decisionmaking, and reliance on a system of external influence.

This Article argues that to best understand online speech, we must abandon traditional doctrinal and regulatory analogies and understand these private content platforms as systems of governance. These platforms are now responsible for shaping and allowing participation in our new digital and democratic culture, yet they have little direct accountability to their users. Future intervention, if any, must take into account how and why these platforms regulate online speech in order to strike a balance between preserving the democratizing forces of the internet and protecting the generative power of our New Governors.},

Often, policymakers and tech industry players invoke artificial intelligence as the solution to complex challenges around online content, promising that {AI} is a scant few years away from resolving everything from hate speech to harassment to the spread of terrorist propaganda. Missing from these promises, however, is an acknowledgement that proactive identification and automated removal of user-generated content raises problems beyond issues of “accuracy” and overbreadth--problems that will not be solved with more sophisticated {AI}. In this commentary, I discuss how the technical realities of content filtering stack up against the protections for freedom of expression in international human rights law. As policymakers and companies around the world turn to {AI} for communications governance, it is crucial that we recall why legal protections for speech have included presumptions against prior censorship, and consider carefully how proactive content moderation will fundamentally re-shape the relationship between rules, people, and their speech.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing amount of user-generated content online has led, in recent years, to an expansion in research and investment in automated content analysis tools. Scrutiny of automated content analysis has accelerated during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, as social networking services have placed a greater reliance on these tools due to concerns about health risks to their moderation staff from in-person work. At the same time, there are important policy debates around the world about how to improve content moderation while protecting free expression and privacy. In order to advance these debates, we need to understand the potential role of automated content analysis tools.

This paper explains the capabilities and limitations of tools for analyzing online multimedia content and highlights the potential risks of using these tools at scale without accounting for their limitations. It focuses on two main categories of tools: matching models and computer prediction models. Matching models include cryptographic and perceptual hashing, which compare user-generated content with existing and known content. Predictive models (including computer vision and computer audition) are machine learning techniques that aim to identify characteristics of new or previously unknown content.},

	shorttitle = {Moderating the Fediverse},
	abstract = {Current approaches to content moderation generally assume the continued dominance of “walled gardens”: social media platforms that control who can use their services and how. But an emerging form of decentralized social media—the "Fediverse"—offers an alternative model, one more akin to how email works and that avoids many of the pitfalls of centralized moderation. This essay, which builds on an emerging literature around decentralized social media, seeks to give an overview of the Fediverse, its benefits and drawbacks, and how government action can influence and encourage its development.Part I describes the Fediverse and how it works, beginning with a general description of open versus closed protocols and then proceeding to a description of the current Fediverse ecosystem, focusing on its major protocols and applications. Part {II} looks at the specific issue of content moderation on the Fediverse, using Mastodon, a Twitter-like microblogging service, as a case study to draw out the advantages and disadvantages of the federated content-moderation approach as compared to the current dominant closed-platform model. Part {III} considers how policymakers can encourage the Fediverse, whether through direct regulation, antitrust enforcement, or liability shields.},

Less attention has been given to studying the conditions that motivate candidates to employ negative campaign tactics. I attempt to move our understanding of this process forward by unifying hypotheses suggested in the literature into a more cohesive theoretical framework and testing them against data collected from all available campaign advertisements produced by major party presidential candidates competing in the 1976-1996 general elections. The results of the logit analysis indicate that candidates' decisions to go negative are a function of changes to the campaign environment, the dynamic interplay that develops between candidates over the course of campaigns, and attributes of issues on the campaign agenda.},

	abstract = {Public opinion, as necessary a concept it is to the underpinnings of democracy, is a socially constructed representation of the public that is forged by the methods and data from which it is derived, as well as how it is understood by those tasked with evaluating and utilizing it. I examine how social media manifests as public opinion in the news and how these practices shape journalistic routines. I draw from a content analysis of news stories about the 2016 {US} election, as well as interviews with journalists, to shed light on evolving practices that inform the use of social media to represent public opinion. I find that despite social media users not reflecting the electorate, the press reported online sentiments and trends as a form of public opinion that services the horserace narrative and complements survey polling and vox populi quotes. These practices are woven into professional routines ? journalists looked to social media to reflect public opinion, especially in the wake of media events like debates. Journalists worried about an overreliance on social media to inform coverage, especially Dataminr alerts and journalists? own highly curated Twitter feeds. Hybrid flows of information between journalists, campaigns, and social media companies inform conceptions of public opinion.},

	title = {Questioning Questions in the Law of Democracy: What the Debate over Voter {ID} Laws' Effects Teaches about Asking the Right Questions},
	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3942940},
	shorttitle = {Questioning Questions in the Law of Democracy},
	abstract = {Voter identification laws, laws that require voters to present identification when voting (“voter {ID} laws”), first launched the modern Voting Wars.  After the Supreme Court blessed Indiana’s voter {ID} law in Crawford v. Marion County, voter {ID} laws proliferated across the country.  Their prevalence belie their notoriety.  They remain one of the most hotly contested election laws and are often referred to as a voter suppression law, if not the modern voter suppression law.     While these laws first served as a rallying cry for the election law/law of democracy community, they have become a sore spot—even a pain point—for what is historically a collaborative and close community of social scientists, lawyers, and legal scholars.  Many social scientists have come to conclude that voter {ID} laws have had negligible effects, if any, on voter turnout.  That conclusion may seem surprising—even difficult to believe—given how many eligible voters lack {IDs}. And that surprising conclusion has raised uncomfortable questions about whether the progressive legal alarm over voter {ID} laws—including litigation challenging those laws—was warranted.     By harmonizing the causal social science literature and descriptive evidence unearthed in the course of litigation, this Article is the first to offer an account of why empiricists have consistently failed to detect a turnout effect from voter {ID} laws.  Upon investigation, what is surprising is not that a turnout effect has not been detected, but why an effect should have been expected in the first place. Evidence from litigation suggests that more than 99\% of registered voters who habitually vote may have the requisite {ID} for voting, even though large numbers of eligible (but not registered) citizens lack {IDs}.  It is therefore unsurprising that the best causal studies suggest that voter {ID} laws decreased turnout (i.e. voting conditional on registration) by no more than 2\%.  Those studies should not have expected any other result: existing causal studies sought to detect an effect that descriptive evidence did not support.  Thus, the discord in the literature results not from the sidelining of important causal findings, but rather from the lack of interaction between the causal academic literature and litigation-derived descriptive evidence.     Resolution of the debate on the turnout effects of voter {ID} laws has far-reaching implications for the election law community.  For legal scholars in particular, it highlights important responsibilities in maintaining the interdisciplinary relationship with social scientists.  The traditional notion of the interdisciplinary relationship between empiricists and lawyers in the field of election law/law of democracy is one of answering questions and questioning answers: social scientists offer empirical answers to questions posed by lawyers, and lawyers in turn question the relevance, importance, and weight of the empirical answers provided by social scientists. Resolution of the debate over voter {ID} laws’ effects suggests that election law scholarship should also question questions: lawyers should not only question the empirical answers that social scientists offer, but also their hypotheses and methods in reaching those answers.     The voter {ID} debate supplies two additional examples of questions worth questioning.  First, is the estimated effect big or small? Social scientific assumptions in interpreting empirical effect sizes do not hold for legal evaluation.  While social scientists are interested in comparing the explanatory force of election laws against all other drivers of turnout, legal interest is limited to how an election law compares to other laws.  Second, is the law in question a voter suppression law?  In assuming that laws that do not depress turnout are not voter suppressive, social scientists confuse vote suppression with voter suppression.  Understanding an election laws’ suppressive effects solely through turnout evidence ignores burdens that voters take on to comply with onerous laws, as well as mounting barriers that further discourage disaffected individuals from voting.Questioning questions also helps clarify doctrine.  I consider how courts hearing challenges to voter {ID} laws have applied—and mis-applied—turnout evidence in conducting the burden inquiry in the Anderson/Burdick standard governing federal constitutional protections for the right to vote. Anderson/Burdick standard balances the burdens imposed by the challenged law on the right to vote against the state’s justification for the law.  Causal evidence of turnout effects is a clearly efficient—but also radically incomplete—measure of burdens on the right to vote.  Conceptual clarity of both what turnout estimates measure and what doctrine asks ensures not only that all relevant evidence is presented and considered in voting-rights cases, but also that the social science literature is better positioned to produce doctrinally responsive research.​},

Zauderer provides a relaxed level of scrutiny for Constitutional challenges to some compelled commercial speech disclosure laws. Regulators throughout the country are adopting “transparency” laws to force Internet services to disclose information about their editorial operations or decisions when they publish third-party content, based on their assumption that Zauderer permits such compelled disclosures. This article explains why these transparency laws do not qualify for Zauderer’s relaxed scrutiny. Instead, given the inevitably censorial consequences of enacting and enforcing compelled editorial transparency laws, they should usually trigger strict scrutiny—just like outright speech restrictions do.},

	abstract = {Despite its constitutional provenance and majestic grandeur , the Supreme Court of the United States operates like any other court. Although its judgments bind the parties before the Court, its precedents are not self-executing for nonparties. The distinction between the Supreme Court’s judgments and precedents is often conflated due to Cooper v. Aaron. This landmark 1958 decision was spurred by the desegregation crisis in Little Rock, Arkansas. Cooper articulated two concepts under which the Supreme Court’s precedents operate as binding judgments on everyone. First, the Justices announced the doctrine that came to be known as judicial supremacy: a simple majority of the Supreme Court could now declare, with finality, the “supreme Law of the Land.” Second, Cooper asserted a principle this Article calls judicial universality: the Supreme Court’s constitutional interpretations obligate not only the parties in a given case, but also other similarly situated parties in later cases.Cooper, which was signed by all nine Justices, represented that these two doctrines were “basic” and premised on “settled doctrine.” Not so. Rather, they were novel assertions of judicial power that were and remain entirely inconsistent with how all courts, including the Supreme Court, operate. Through a careful study of the papers of Justices Black, Brennan, Burton, Clark, Douglas, Frankfurter, Harlan, and Chief Justice Warren, this Article exposes the constitutional origins of this irrepressible myth.},

We conducted three experiments in which we randomly assigned participants to view a negative ad that was identical except for its sponsor. We find that candidates can benefit from having a party or group “do their dirty work,” but particularly if a group does, and that the most likely explanation for why this is the case is that many voters simply do not connect candidates to the ads sponsored by parties and groups. We also find that in some circumstances, a group-sponsored attack ad produces less polarization than one sponsored by a party.

Most notably, party ownership's impact is demonstrated to be weak: candidates are more willing to ‘trespass’ or talk about the other party's issues than previous literature has found. Also ‘trespassing’ is shown to be facilitated by framing the other party's issues in certain ways.

	abstract = {Ernst Cassirer occupies a unique place in twentieth-centuryphilosophy. His work pays equal attention to foundational andepistemological issues in the philosophy of mathematics and naturalscience and to aesthetics, the philosophy of history, and other issuesin the “cultural sciences” broadly conceived. More thanany other German philosopher since Kant, Cassirer thus aims to devoteequal philosophical attention both to the (mathematical and) naturalsciences (Naturwissenschaften) and to the more humanisticdisciplines (Geisteswissenschaften). In this way, Cassirer,more than any other twentieth-century philosopher, plays a fundamentalmediating role between C. P. Snow’s famous “twocultures.” He also plays a similarly mediating role between thetwo major traditions in twentieth-century academic philosophy –the “analytic” and “continental” traditions– whose radically different (and often mutually uncomprehending)perspectives on the relationship between scientific and humanisticelements in their subject gave rise to a fundamental split or gulfbetween philosophy as it came to be practiced in the Anglo-Americanworld, on the one side, and as it was practiced in most of the rest ofthe world, on the other. Cassirer, by contrast, had fruitfulphilosophical relations with leading members of both traditions– with Moritz Schlick, the founder and guiding spirit of {theVienna} Circle of logical empiricists, whose work in logic and thephilosophy of science had a decisive influence on the development ofphilosophy in the United States, and with Martin Heidegger, thecreator of a radical “existential-hermeneutical” versionof Husserlian phenomenology which quickly became dominant incontinental Europe.},

Objects in space and time are said to be“appearances”, and he argues that we know nothing ofsubstance about the things in themselves of which they areappearances. Kant calls this doctrine (or set of doctrines)“transcendental idealism”, and ever since the publicationof the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason in 1781,Kant’s readers have wondered, and debated, what exactly transcendentalidealism is, and have developed quite different interpretations. Some,including many of Kant’s contemporaries, interpret transcendentalidealism as essentially a form of phenomenalism, similar in somerespects to that of Berkeley, while others think that it is not ametaphysical or ontological theory at all. There is probably no majorinterpretive question in Kant’s philosophy on which there is so littleconsensus.

In the context of this article, the word myth is attributed to the extravagant quixotic interpretation in anecdote (in both visionary and narrative sense) of what is accomplished or ceased as a key or essential phenomenon. The terms or language concepts of cosmogonic or creation invoke the start of things, whether by the desire and action of a surpass Actuality, by emergence from some eventful Actuality or by an additional alternative process. Mystics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of today set forward a method, to my mind, of pluralistic interpretation of the whole understanding and interpretation of a cosmogonic and creation myth that includes a variety of Actualities (deities or gods), in the world, according to basic Western and Eastern religious and rational classifications. These rational classifications have a phenomenological epistemic impact and even a certain righteousness of   whoever wants to believe whatever of creation  .

The use of these predictive scores has increased dramatically since 2004, and their use could yield sizable gains to campaigns that harness them. At the same time, their widespread use effectively creates a coordination game with incomplete information between allied organizations.

	abstract = {Numerous get-out-the-vote ({GOTV}) interventions are successful in raising voter turnout. However, these increases may not be evenly distributed across the electorate and could potentially increase the differences between voters and nonvoters. By analyzing individual level-data, we reassess previous {GOTV} experiments to determine which interventions mobilize under-represented citizens versus those who regularly turn out. We develop a generalized and exportable test which indicates whether a particular intervention reduces or exacerbates disparities in political participation and apply it to 24 previous experimental interventions. On average, current mobilization strategies significantly widen disparities in participation by mobilizing high-propensity individuals more than the under-represented, low-propensity citizens. The results hold troubling implications for the study and improvement of political inequality, but the methodological procedures laid out in this study may assist the development and testing of future strategies which reverse this pattern.},

Despite decades of research aiming to understand what drives citizens to the polls, the jury is still out on what the foundations of micro-level turnout are. This paper aims to provide a modest yet important contribution by taking a step back and summarizing where we stand and what we know. To this end, we review 90 empirical studies of individual level voter turnout in national elections published in ten top-journals during the past decade (2000–2010). Through a meta-analysis of the results reported in these studies, this paper identifies those factors that are consistently linked to individual level turnout.},

	abstract = {Political observers, campaign experts, and academics alike argue bitterly over whether it is more important for a party to capture ideologically moderate swing voters or to encourage turnout among hardcore partisans. The behavioral literature in American politics suggests that voters are not informed enough, and are too partisan, to be swing voters, while the institutional literature suggests that moderate candidates tend to perform better. We speak to this debate by examining the link between the ideology of congressional candidates and the turnout of their parties’ bases in {US} House races, 2006–2014. Combining a regression discontinuity design in close primary races with survey and administrative data on individual voter turnout, we find that extremist nominees—as measured by the mix of campaign contributions they receive—suffer electorally, largely because they decrease their party’s share of turnout in the general election, skewing the electorate towards their opponent’s party. The results help show how the behavioral and institutional literatures can be connected. For our sample of elections, turnout appears to be the dominant force in determining election outcomes, but it advantages ideologically moderate candidates because extremists appear to activate the opposing party’s base more than their own.},

However, such a strategy assumes that {GOTV} efforts are effective at increasing turnout in this population, and the extant research offers contradictory evidence regarding the empirical validity of this assumption. We propose a model where only those citizens whose propensity to vote is near the indifference threshold are mobilized to vote and the threshold is determined by the general interest in the election. Our three-parameter model reconciles prior inconsistent empirical results and argues that low-propensity voters can be effectively mobilized only in high-turnout elections. The model is tested on 11 randomized face-to-face voter mobilization field experiments in which we specifically analyze whether subjects' baseline propensity to vote conditions the effectiveness of door-to-door {GOTV} canvassing. The evidence is consistent with the model and suggests that face-to-face mobilization is better at stimulating turnout among low-propensity voters in prominent elections than it is in quiescent ones.},

In Study 1, we first assess participants’ extraversion trait by means of their own text data (i.e., by using a personality profiling algorithm), and in a second phase, target them with either a personality-congruent or incongruent political ad. In Study 2, we followed the same protocol, but instead targeted participants with emotionally-charged congruent ads, to establish whether {PMT} can be effective on an affect-based level. The results show evidence that citizens are more strongly persuaded by political ads that match their own personality traits.

With the demise of these organizations, grassroots contacts declined, reaching only 18 percent of the electorate by 1992, before rebounding to over 40 percent by 2008. Using respondent reports of party contacts from the American National Election Studies, this article documents how the recent surge in mobilization is tied to the strategic priorities of the national parties and presidential campaigns. They concentrate their efforts on the most likely voters in the most competitive ‘battleground’ states, resulting in both positive and negative consequences for American democracy. In ramping up party contacts, who is contacted has changed, becoming more readily predictable, and the American electoral process has been transformed.},

The Summer of 1787 traces the struggles within the Philadelphia Convention as the delegates hammered out the charter for the world’s first constitutional democracy. Relying on the words of the delegates themselves to explore the Convention’s sharp conflicts and hard bargaining, David O. Stewart lays out the passions and contradictions of the, often, painful process of writing the Constitution. It was a desperate balancing act. Revolutionary principles required that the people have power, but could the people be trusted? Would a stronger central government leave room for the states? Would the small states accept a Congress in which seats were allotted according to population rather than to each sovereign state? And what of slavery? The supercharged debates over America’s original sin led to the most creative and most disappointing political deals of the Convention. The room was crowded with colorful and passionate characters, some known—Alexander Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, Edmund Randolph—and others largely forgotten. At different points during that sultry summer, more than half of the delegates threatened to walk out, and some actually did, but Washington’s quiet leadership and the delegates’ inspired compromises held the Convention together. In a country continually arguing over the document’s original intent, it is fascinating to watch these powerful characters struggle toward consensus—often reluctantly—to write a flawed but living and breathing document that could evolve with the nation.},

	title = {The Relational Conception of War Powers},
	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1664825},
	abstract = {This essay defends a “relational” account of war authority, one premised on the value of maintaining the branches in relationships of mutual review, even when that review leads to interbranch interpretive conflict. Against the norm of interpretive unity that is offered by settlement theorists, the relational conception of war authority sees value in interbranch interpretive struggle. In some cases, interpretive struggle, by clarifying what is at stake in a particular security context, can generate more constitutional authority than would be the case if one branch were highly deferential. In other cases, interpretive struggle can lead the branches to develop governance and interpretive capacities that are useful for broader constitutional aims. While this essay does not develop the full contours of the relational model, it does demonstrate the model’s value for understanding two critical war acts: Kennedy’s response to the Cuban missile crisis, and Nixon’s Cambodian incursion. Exploring the relational model through these cases reveals the tremendous difference between the questions raised by a settlement approach and those raised by a relational approach. Ultimately, whereas the settlement model either defends or condemns together the presidential conduct in each case, the relational account reveals subtle yet critical constitutional differences between Kennedy’s and Nixon’s acts of war.},

	abstract = {Given that the Latino community is the second largest ethnic group in the {US}, an understanding of how Latinos are discussed and targeted on social media during {US} elections is crucial. This paper explores these questions through a data analysis on Reddit, one of the most prominent and popular social media platforms for political discussion. We collected Reddit posts mentioning Latinos and the {US} midterm elections from September 24, 2017 to September 24, 2018. We analyzed people's posting patterns over time, and the digital traces of the individuals posting the majority of content and the most popular content. Our research highlights data voids that existed in online discussions surrounding Latinos prior to the {US} midterm elections. We observe a lack of neutral actors engaging Latinos in political topics. It appears that it is the more extremist voices (i.e. individuals operating within subreddits who identify themselves as political trolls) who are creating the most political content about Latinos. We conclude our report with a discussion of the possible dangers of data voids (especially with regard to their ties to mis- and disinformation) and recommendations to increase the involvement of the Latino community in future {US} elections.},

	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2784336},
	abstract = {Twenty-six years after Employment Division v. Smith, the lower courts remain divided about its meaning. What does it mean for a law to be “generally applicable”? The Ninth Circuit recently upheld a regulation on facts as extreme as those in Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah (1993). But other courts have held that a law is not generally applicable if it allows even one secular exception that undermines the state’s asserted interests in regulating religion. Close analysis of Smith and Lukumi reveals that the one-secular-exception interpretation is correct. The Court’s discussions of the “object” of a law, of religious “gerrymanders,” and of discrimination “because of” religion, appear only with respect to neutrality; none of these concepts are even mentioned with respect to general applicability. The Court’s reaffirmance of the unemployment-benefits cases show that even very narrow exceptions make a law less than generally applicable. Sound policy reasons support this more literal understanding of general applicability. Exempting secular but not religious activities that undermine alleged government interests deprives religious minorities of vicarious political protection and demonstrates a forbidden value judgment: the exempted secular activities are more valuable, more deserving of legal protection, than the unexempted exercise of religion. This understanding of general applicability implements, in the face of regulatory complexity, a rule prohibiting discrimination against the free exercise of religion.},

	title = {Free Exercise (Dis)Honesty},
	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3262826},
	abstract = {For over half a century, the Supreme Court’s free exercise jurisprudence has been characterized by a less-than-forthright treatment of precedent. The pattern began in the 1960s, when Justice Brennan led the Court to recognize a right to religious exemptions while ignoring language from past cases that had rejected such a right. The trend continued in the 1990s, when Justice Scalia led the Court to disavow the pro-exemption view while ignoring language in cases that had embraced it. Today, the Court appears poised to shift its position on religious exemptions yet again, and leading scholars are suggesting it do so by creatively rewriting precedent.This Article urges the Justices to decline that invitation and make clear they are no longer willing to read free exercise precedents saying “up” to mean “mostly down.” Part I tells the full story of foundational prevarications and subsidiary inconsistencies that have accompanied the Court’s past shifts on exemption rights. Part {II} details the greatest danger of dishonesty going forward—a danger that was lurking in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Part {III} calls on the Court to develop an honest free exercise jurisprudence and offers suggestions for what that jurisprudence might look like. Specifically, because the Court has at times incorrectly assumed that recognizing exemption rights will either risk anarchy or require treacherous balancing of religious interests against state interests, this Article offers a concrete proposal for vindicating a limited right to religious exemptions without engaging in case-by-case balancing of such interests. But regardless of whether the Court embraces that proposal, it should at long last engage in a thorough reexamination of its sharply conflicting precedents and seriously consider the nuances and middle-ground arguments those precedents have steadfastly ignored. By finally turning to that task, the Court could deliver what has been missing from its free exercise jurisprudence for so long: honesty.},

	abstract = {"A narrative account of the relationship between the U.S. and China from the Revolutionary War to the present day. Our relationship with China remains one of the most complex and rapidly evolving, and is perhaps one of the most important to our nation's future. Here, John Pomfret, the author of the bestselling Chinese Lessons, takes us deep into these two countries' shared history, and illuminates in vibrant, stunning detail every major event, relationship, and ongoing development that has affected diplomacy between these two booming, influential nations. We meet early American missionaries and chart their influence in China, and follow a group of young Chinese students who enroll in American universities, eager to soak up Western traditions. We witness firsthand major and devastating events like the Boxer Rebellion, and the rise of Mao. We examine both nations' involvement in world events, such as World War I and {II}. Pomfret takes the myriad historical milestones of two of the world's most powerful nations and turns them into one fluid, fascinating story, leaving us with a nuanced understanding of where these two nations stand in relation to one another, and the rest of the world"--},

	abstract = {Fringe groups and organizations have a long history of using euphemisms—ordinary-sounding words with a secret meaning—to conceal what they are discussing. Nowadays, one common use of euphemisms is to evade content moderation policies enforced by social media platforms. Existing tools for enforcing policy automatically rely on keyword searches for words on a “ban list”, but these are notoriously imprecise: even when limited to swearwords, they can still cause embarrassing false positives [1]. When a commonly used ordinary word acquires a euphemistic meaning, adding it to a keyword-based ban list is hopeless: consider “pot” (storage container or marĳuana?) or “heater” (household appliance or ﬁrearm?) The current generation of social media companies instead hire staﬀ to check posts manually, but this is expensive, inhumane, and not much more eﬀective. It is usually apparent to a human moderator that a word is being used euphemistically, but they may not know what the secret meaning is, and therefore whether the message violates policy. Also, when a euphemism is banned, the group that used it need only invent another one, leaving moderators one step behind.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Various forms of {AI} and automation are used in ranking and recommendation systems that curate the massive amounts of content available online. The use of these technologies raises significant questions about the influence of {AI} on our information environment and, ultimately, on our rights to freedom of expression and access to information.

The prevailing form of Spanish national identity at that time was completely dependent on Catholicism; the medieval Iberian past was understood as a struggle of national liberation against invading Muslims, culminating in a final Christian victory in 1492. This approach generated an exclusionary vision of al-Andalus as alien to Spanish identity, expressed through the notion of “Reconquista,” which reached its peak during the Franco dictatorship, the heyday of National Catholic ideology. Although the idea of Reconquista lost its historiographical hegemony after the arrival of democracy in 1978, recent events show that, despite its strong ideological connotations, or perhaps because of them, it remains the key concept in defining the medieval period within the most conservative sectors of academia, politics, and the media.},

The electoral success of the radical right-wing challenger, Vox, who gained 11\% of the vote and 12 seats in the regional parliament, brought this exceptionalism to an end. This paper analyses the individual-level determinants that explain the electoral success of Vox and the emergence of the radical right within the Spanish party system. The results indicate that concerns over devolution, likely engendered by the Catalan separatist crisis, predominantly explain voters’ preferences for the right-wing challenger. This is true both amongst the general electorate as well as amongst the former voters of other right-wing parties. Significantly, against popular assumptions and empirical observations explaining the rise of radical right-wing parties across much of Western Europe, the results display no empirical link between immigration and electoral support for Vox.},

	shorttitle = {China’s Changing Perspective on the {WTO}},
	abstract = {Twenty years after it became a Member of the {WTO}, China’s image in popular perception has shifted from the biggest success story of the world trading system to its biggest challenge. In the past few years, tons of research have been conducted on what other {WTO} Members should or could do to deal with the China challenge, but not much attempt has been made to understand the Chinese perspective on its {WTO} Membership. Focusing only on the China challenge without understanding the Chinese perspective is rather problematic as it treats China as a passive object rather than an active subject, one with significant economic and political clouts in the world trading system today. This paper fills the research gap by providing the first systemic review of this important yet ignored question, which in my view, would be the key to address the China challenge. The paper argues that the Chinese perspective on the {WTO} has changed from viewing it as the symbol for its aspiration to integrate into the world economy, to trying to assimilate the Chinese economic system with that of the market-based multilateral trading system, to increasing alienations with the core values of {WTO} in response to the attacks on its economic system. The paper concludes with lessons drawing from China’s changing perspective, especially on how to manage the China challenge in the multilateral trading system.},

Six case studies are then documented where a coercive frame is evident in reporting and commentary to interpret Chinese actions taken against Australian exports since 2017. These show that trade impacts of Chinese actions have generally been modest in scale, short-lived and/or significantly mitigated. Canberra’s political positions have also not become more aligned with Beijing’s. The discussion informs assessment of coercive risks consequent to Australia’s trade exposure to China.},
