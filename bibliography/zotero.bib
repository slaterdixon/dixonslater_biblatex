	abstract = {This article estimates the impact of local housing and labor market conditions on area homelessness using the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's ({HUD}’s) annual point-in-time counts of homelessness from 2007 to 2014. In cross-sectional models, the median rent, the share of households in rental housing, and the poverty rate have strong positive impacts on homelessness. Once area-fixed effects are included, only the median rent remains positive and significant. However, fixed-effect models find a positive relationship between poverty and homelessness in communities that maintain right-to-shelter policies, suggesting constraints in shelter bed supply may limit responses of homelessness to changes in economic conditions.},

The approach is more idiosyncratic than encyclopedic. The field has been converging on the conclusion that housing subsidies are the most attractive policy for reducing homelessness, but the optimal arrangement of subsidies is not obvious. Economists have much to contribute, in both theory—mechanism design and general equilibrium—and empirics. Aggregate-level studies can be used more for finding out what the effects of different policies are, and individual-level studies can be used more for assessing the costs and benefits of those effects.},

One of the most important ways we see "fragmented federalism" is in the patchwork of policies across the country, created by factions and implemented in fragments across and within conflicted institutions throughout 2012-13. Implementation of various policies—notably education and health care—has been plagued by partisanship, pushback, and uncertainty. Operating under conditions of fiscal stress and a federal budget plagued by roadblocks has further complicated planning and program implementation at all government levels. Finally, Supreme Court decisions continue to contribute to the fragmented nature of federalism by alternately protecting state sovereignty from federal intrusion and at other times endorsing broad federal preemption of state laws.},

In spite of the popular aura of campaigns using secretive and sophisticated techniques to engage with voters, the book shows that most of what campaigns know about voters comes from a core set of public records. States vary in the kinds of records they collect from voters. Sometimes, state legislators pass laws about data collection for the very purpose of using government-collected personal data for their campaigns. The variation in data across the country means that campaign databases look different in different areas. Consequently, campaigns vary how they engage with voters in different areas because of the data that permit them to perceive voters' interests. Variations in data policy thus affect the kinds of electoral coalitions that campaigns build"--},

	abstract = {The international telecommunications regime provided a multilateral framework that reinforced domestic monopolies and bilateral cartel arrangements in the global market. The regime's epistemic community believed that telecommunications services and equipment were best supplied by national monopolies and that international communications by telephone, telegram, and telex should be jointly provided by monopolists. Strong domestic political incentives reinforced this cognitive framework. When technological innovation triggered a successful political attack on the domestic regulation of telecommunications in a few key countries, the stage was set for a global challenge to the intellectual and political foundations of the regime. Two paths to reform have emerged. Their significance can be assessed by looking at changes in the distribution of benefits from the regime, changes in the manner in which governments delegate power to the regime, and shifts in the epistemic community associated with the regime.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to examine the influence of private corporations in the tripartite structure of the International Telecommunications Union ({ITU}): Telecommunications Standardization, Radiocommunication, and Telecommunications Development. The paper finds that, in the standardization sector, power has been effectively transferred from nation states to the private corporate sector since the approval process now enables standards to be approved by members of the study group that developed them, which is essentially the private sector. In the radiocommunication sector, the private sector continues to conduct much of the requisite technical work, but national governments are ultimately the decision makers and, further, it is difficult to distinguish between treaty and nontreaty work. In the development sector, the {ITU} seeks to create an enabling environment for private investment in developing countries and actively seeks to build private sector partnerships. In the long run the {ITU} may be unable to satisfy either its narrow corporate constituency or the vast majority of its developing country members. As the United Nations agency which coordinates satellite spacing and allocates access to the electromagnetic spectrum on an international basis, the {ITU} is the world's most prominent international telecommunications institution, so its structural modifications and membership changes are of great significance in a world increasingly dependent on a global grid of wired and wireless telecommunications networks.},

	volume = {59},
	issn = {0020-8183},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/3877878},
	abstract = {The concept of power is central to international relations. Yet disciplinary discussions tend to privilege only one, albeit important, form: an actor controlling another to do what that other would not otherwise do. By showing conceptual favoritism, the discipline not only overlooks the different forms of power in international politics, but also fails to develop sophisticated understandings of how global outcomes are produced and how actors are differentially enabled and constrained to determine their fates. We argue that scholars of international relations should employ multiple conceptions of power and develop a conceptual framework that encourages rigorous attention to power in its different forms. We first begin by producing a taxonomy of power. Power is the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate. This general concept entails two crucial, analytical dimensions: the kinds of social relations through which power works (in relations of interaction or in social relations of constitution); and the specificity of social relations through which effects are produced (specific/direct or diffuse/indirect). These distinctions generate our taxonomy and four concepts of power: compulsory, institutional, structural, and productive. We then illustrate how attention to the multiple forms of power matters for the analysis of global governance and American empire. We conclude by urging scholars to beware of the idea that the multiple concepts are competing, and instead to see connections between them in order to generate more robust understandings of how power works in international politics.},

	shorttitle = {Imagining the U.s.-Mexico Drug War},
	abstract = {In the last decade, violence attributed to Latin American drug cartels has become a common theme in a proliferation of fiction and non-fiction about the drug trade written both in Mexico and the U.S. This essay shows how the majority of Mexican narconarratives—in particular the works of writers such as Orfa Alarcón, Yuri Herrera, Élmer Mendoza, Heriberto Yépez, and Juan Pablo Villalobos—while conceived as critical literary interventions, are in fact marketable commodities reproducing hegemonic discourses that frame the drug trade as a phenomenon operating outside of the state. Mexican narconarratives reify a mythology of drug cartels and their kingpins: that the violence threatening the country is attributable only to narcos, who radically oppose civil society and its government. However, there is an emerging current of narconarratives that articulate an effective critique of the drug trade as a dimension located within state structures, historically determined by state power and subject to it. The novels analyzed include Contrabando (Contraband) by Mexican author Víctor Hugo Rascón Banda, 2666 by Chilean author Roberto Bolaño, and The Power of the Dog and Down by the River by U.S. writers Don Winslow and Charles Bowden, respectively. Reconsidering the classical notion of mimesis, this essay contends that, despite their varying proximity to their common referent—the drug trade—and their differing practices of realism, most narco-narratives replicate official representations of drug cartels. It is through a critical approach to the drug trade, as it intersects the power of the state, that alternative narconarratives resist the mediation of hegemonic discourses that permeate the fields of journalism, academic research, and literature.},

The frontier is represented as an unruly, marginal and ‘ungoverned’ space, a magnate for drug traffickers, rebels and migrants. These ‘non state’ or ‘anti state’ spaces are believed to have a comparative advantage in illegality, with borderlands and frontiers becoming centres for the production, consumption and trafficking of illicit drugs. Linked to this representation is a policy narrative and set of assumptions that statebuilding, peacebuilding, development and counter narcotics policies are mutually reinforcing, and involve the extension of a state presence into these frontier zones, along with effective drug eradication, substitution and development activities. In spite of the evident inaccuracy of this portrayal of the ‘narco-frontier’ the imaginary is extremely resilient and continues to be reflected and reinforced in policy texts and narratives. This paper asks why has this been the case. What ideological work does the imaginary perform and for whom? And what are the implications of an alternative imaginary of the margins?},

Moreover, cultural historians who have pioneered new ways of looking at symbolic and expressive forms of power have tended to slight the more traditional dimensions of power--such as persisting elite hegemony and control of material resources--that ought not be excluded from the concept's domain. Historians would do well to attend more fully to the implications of political culture, especially its inherently comparative logic.},

	abstract = {States have adopted online voter registration in the past few years to save on data entry costs and increase voter turnout. In 2010 when online voter registration was newly introduced in eight states, we conducted a field experiment with 25 colleges involving more than 130,000 unregistered students designed to increase awareness of the new registration tool. Students were randomly assigned to receive an email linking to the new registration portal, receive an email linking to the older downloadable registration form, or a control group that received no email about voter registration. Student registry data was then checked against voter files to look at relative rates of registration and voter turnout across treatment conditions. We estimate that linking to the downloadable form increased registration rates by 0.6 percentage points and did not affect turnout rates at all. In contrast, emails linking to the online registration portal increased registration rates by 1.2 percentage points and turnout rates by 0.5 percentage points, which are large effects relative to other mobilization techniques.},

Since 1990, at least 60,000 people have been killed-insurgents, civilians, and military and police personnel. In 2019, the conflict entered a dangerous new phase. India's Hindu nationalist government, under Narendra Modi, repealed Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir's autonomous status and divided it into two territories subject to New Delhi's direct rule. The drastic move was accompanied by mass arrests and lengthy suspension of mobile and internet services. In this definitive account, Sumantra Bose examines the conflict in Kashmir from its origins to the present volatile juncture. He explores the global context of the current situation, including China's growing role, as well as the human tragedy of the people caught in the bitter dispute. Drawing on three decades of field experience in Kashmir, Bose asks whether a compromise settlement is still possible given the ascendancy of Hindu nationalism in India and the complex geopolitical context"--},

	abstract = {This article studies the conditions that lead peripheral minorities to identify with the state, their ethnic group, or neighboring countries. We contribute to research on separatism and irredentism by examining how violence, psychological distance, and national status determine identification. The analysis uses data from a novel experiment that randomized videos of actual violence in a large, representative survey of the Kashmir Valley region in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, an enduring site of separatist and irredentist conflict. We find that a strong regional identity is a counter-weight to irredentism, but violent repression by the state can push members of the minority to identify with an irredentist neighbor. Violence increases perceived distance from the nation and reduces national identification. There is suggestive evidence that these effects are concentrated among individuals with attributes that otherwise predict higher levels of identification with the state. Information about integrative institutions and increased national status brought about by economic growth is insufficient to induce national identification in a context where psychological distance from the nation is large.},

This Article canvasses and builds upon the burgeoning development of Internet law. It suggests that the Internet's impact on economic regulation is best understood by classifying its effects into four categories, each of which requires a different regulatory response. It also considers potential solutions for adapting economic regulation to the Internet. This Article concludes that no single suitable solution or analogy remedies the regulatory challenges posed by the Internet.

	abstract = {Drawing on Justice Brandeis 's oft-cited observation that states can serve as "laboratories " of policy experimentation, this Article develops a framework for assessing the allocation of governance authority for regulating Internet activities. In particular, it focuses on whether states should be free to experiment with regulatory approaches or whether the federal government should have principal, if not exclusive (preemptive), regulatory authority over Internet-related activities. Using recent efforts to regulate spyware and adware as a case study, the analysis shows that the lack of harmonization of, and uncertainty surrounding, state unfair competition law produces costly, confusing, multi-district litigation and pushes enterprises to adhere to the limits of the most restrictive state. Such a governance regime unduly hinders innovation in Internet business models. On this basis, the Article favors a uniform federal regulatory system and preemption of state statutes and unfair competition common law as applied to spyware and adware. The final section of the Article extrapolates from this study of spyware and adware regulation to the larger context of Internet governance.},

	abstract = {Economic scholarship has recently focused a great deal of attention on the phenomenon of network externalities, or network effects: markets in which the value that consumers place on a good increases as others use the good. Though the economic theory of network effects is of recent origin and is still not thoroughly understood, network effects increasingly play a role in legal argument. Judges, litigators, and scholars have suggested that antitrust law, intellectual property law, telecommunications law, Internet law, corporate law, and contract law need to be modified to take account of network effects. Their arguments reflect a wide range of views about what network effects are and how courts should react to them. In this Article, we explore the application of network economic theory in each of these contexts. We suggest ways in which particular legal rules should-and should not-be modified to take account of network effects. We also attempt to draw some general conclusions about the role of network economic theory in the legal enterprise and about the way in which courts should revise legal doctrines in response to theories from fields outside the law.},

	abstract = {A classic constitutional parable teaches that our federal system of government allows states to function as “laboratories of democracy.” This tale has been passed down from generation to generation, often to justify constitutional protections for state autonomy from the federal government. But scholars have failed to explain how state governments manage to overcome numerous impediments to experimentation, including resource scarcity, free rider problems, and misaligned incentives. This Article maintains that the laboratories account is missing a proper appreciation for the coordinated networks of third-party organizations (such as interest groups, activists, and funders) that often fuel policy innovation. These groups are the real laboratories of democracy today. They perform the lion’s share of tasks necessary to enact new policies; they create incentives that motivate elected officials to support their preferred policies; and they mobilize the power of the federal government to change the landscape against which state experimentation occurs. If our federal system of government seeks to encourage policy experimentation, then courts should endeavor to create ground rules for regulating competition between political networks, rather than continuing futile efforts to protect state autonomy. This Article concludes by sketching some implications for several areas of legal doctrine, including federal preemption of state law, conditional spending, and the anticommandeering principle.},

In this Article, Professor Bebchuk offers an analysis of the dynamics and performance of state charter competition. He shows how the presence of managerial opportunism and externalities may lead states to adopt undesirable corporate law rules. Professor Bebchuk identifies the various issues with respect to which state competition is likely to fail, and he advocates an expansion of federal regulation to govern all of these issues. He also connects the state competition question with the question of contractual freedom in corporate law and argues that many scholars should reconsider their inconsistent views regarding these two questions. Finally, Professor Bebchuk concludes by addressing potential objections to the expansion of federal corporate regulation.},

	abstract = {Seed dispersal syndromes are morphological characters of seeds correlated to particular seed dispersal agents. Dispersal is the event by which individuals move from the site of their parents to establish in a new area. A seed disperser is the vector by which a seed moves from its parent to the resting place where the individual will establish, for instance an animal. Similar to the term syndrome, a diaspore is a morphological functional unit of a seed for dispersal purposes.Characteristics for seed dispersal syndromes are commonly fruit colour, mass, and persistence. These syndrome characteristics are often associated with the fruit that carries the seeds. Fruits are packages for seeds, composed of nutritious tissues to feed animals. However, fruit pulp is not commonly used as a seed dispersal syndrome because pulp nutritional value does not enhance seed dispersal success. Animals interact with these fruits because they are a common food source for them. Although, not all seed dispersal syndromes have fruits because not all seeds are dispersed by animals. Suitable biological and environmental conditions of dispersal syndromes are needed for seed dispersal  and invasion success  such as temperature and moisture.
Seed dispersal syndromes are parallel to pollination syndromes, which are defined as floral characteristics that attract organisms as pollinators. They are considered parallels because they are both plant-animal interactions, which increase the reproductive success of a plant. However, seed dispersal syndromes are more common in gymnosperms, while pollination syndromes are found in angiosperms.
Seeds disperse to increase the reproductive success of the plant. The farther away a seed is from a parent, the better its chances of survival and germination. Therefore, a plant should select certain traits to increase dispersal by a vector (i.e. bird) to increase the reproductive success of the plant.},

In contrast to the traditional tasks for machine learning in computer science and statistics, when machine learning is applied to social scientific data, it is used to discover new concepts, measure the prevalence of those concepts, assess causal effects, and make predictions. The abundance of data and resources facilitates the move away from a deductive social science to a more sequential, interactive, and ultimately inductive approach to inference.

It deals only with those aspects of the subject applicable in the social sciences and provides a thorough understanding of linear algebra for those who wish to use it as a tool in the design, execution, and interpretation of research. Linear mathematical models play an important role in all of the social sciences. This book provides a step-by-step introduction to those parts of linear algebra which are useful in such model building. It illustrates some of the applications of linear analysis and helps the reader learn how to convert his formulation of a social science problem into algebraic terms. The author covers matrix algebra, computational methods, linear models involving discrete variables, and clear, complete explanations of necessary mathematical concepts. Prior knowledge of calculus is not required since no use is made of calculus or of complex numbers. A novel feature of the mathematical content of the book is the treatment of models expressed in terms of variables which must be whole numbers (integers). The book is distinguished by a step-by-step exposition that allows the reader to grasp quickly and fully the principles of linear algebra. All of the examples used to illustrate the text are drawn from the social sciences, enabling the reader to relate the subject to concrete problems in his field. Exercises are included as a necessary part of the text to develop points not covered in the text and to provide practice in the algebraic formulation of applied problems.

	abstract = {Machines are increasingly doing “intelligent” things. Face recognition algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function that predicts the presence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: How do these new empirical tools fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Machine learning not only provides new tools, it solves a different problem. Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or their output is misinterpreted. We hope to make them conceptually easier to use by providing a crisper understanding of how these algorithms work, where they excel, and where they can stumble—and thus where they can be most usefully applied.},

This paper argues that, in these two religiously homogenous yet fragmented states, revolutionary Islamic movements demonstrated a unique social mobilization capacity based on a) their ability to redefine local and national identities in a way that overcame pre-existing fault lines of conflict, b) their ability to frame the solution to civil conflict in simple, yet highly resonant and logically coherent terms, and c) the legitimacy and motivational power offered by charismatic religious leadership.]},

	abstract = {In most accounts, the modern American “tax revolt” begins with Proposition 13, passed by California voters in June 1978. In this telling, the revolt represents an antigovernment, antiliberal shift among white homeowners instrumental in the “rise of the right” and the fall of the “New Deal order” that culminated in Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980 and his subsequent tax cuts. This article challenges that account by demonstrating that the revolt began more than a decade before Prop 13 as approval rates for local levies and bonds reached all-time lows. This local revolt was not limited to whites, nor did it portend rising conservatism. Instead, it was rooted in lower- and middle-income Americans’ frustrations with steep rises in unfair, regressive taxes during the post–World War {II} decades. The Kennedy-Johnson “Growth Liberals,” who were busy cutting progressive federal taxes at the same time that regressive state and local taxes were soaring, missed this pocketbook squeeze, thereby setting the stage for later events like Prop 13.},

Previous studies have indicated that it is costly to provide public services in areas with low-density, spatially expansive development, leading to higher per capita expenditures. However, theory would suggest alternate outcomes. This paper examines this question using a panel dataset of U.S. urban county areas and a specification allowing for potential nonlinearity between development patterns and per capita expenditures. Estimates indicate that the spatial extent of development is the most important factor in expenditures; it is less costly to provide public services when development is more compact. Higher density increases per capita expenditures; however, the effects are small.},

Most people think that the tax-revolt initiative was caused by excessive government spending and rising tax burdens on homeowners. I argue that the California Supreme Court's landmark decision, Serrano v. Priest (1971), crippled the Tiebout system by divorcing local property wealth from school spending. Serrano thus converted most property taxes into a deadweight loss. Voters responded by rejecting the property tax, shifting the school finance burden to the state. My explanation supports the median voter model in contrast to Leviathan theories of state and local government.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a software package designed to estimate Poole and Rosenthal {WNOMINATE} scores in R. The package uses a logistic regression model to analyze political choice data, usually (though not exclusively) from a legislative setting. In contrast to other scaling methods, W-{NOMINATE} explicitly assumes probabilistic voting based on a spatial utility function, where the parameters of the utility function and the spatial coordinates of the legislators and the votes can all be estimated on the basis of observed voting behavior. Building on the W-{NOMINATE} software written by Poole in {FORTRAN}, the new package facilitates easier data input and manipulation, generates bootstrapped standard errors, and includes a new suite of graphics functions to display the results. We demonstrate the functionality of this package by conducting a natural experiment using roll calls —an experiment which is greatly simpliﬁed by the data manipulation capabilities of the W-{NOMINATE} package in R.},

	abstract = {"State legislatures hold tremendous authority over key facets of our lives, in domains ranging from healthcare to education to election administration. And in an era of polarization and frequent policy gridlock at the national level, their significance has only increased. Political scientist Steven Rogers asks what voters know about state legislators, whether they have a meaningful opportunity to register their preferences in state legislative elections, and if there is evidence of accountability for performance in the outcomes of those elections. Drawing on broad-ranging evidence and creative research strategies, Rogers shows that, most often, state legislatures can produce policies contrary to citizens' priorities with little fear of being held accountable at the ballot box. Assembling an encyclopedic range of data on candidacy and retirements, lawmaker issue stances, news coverage, general elections, primaries, electoral competition, legislator effectiveness, state economic performance, public opinion, voter knowledge, and election outcomes, this book foregrounds a major issue: Voters do not know enough about their state representatives. They are often not presented with alternatives in elections where incumbents routinely run unopposed, and outcomes normally fail to correlate with indicators of legislative performance, either for individual lawmakers or in the aggregate performance of state government"--},

Then we address the problem of solving {NMF}, which is {NP}-hard in general. We review some standard {NMF} algorithms, and also present a recent subclass of {NMF} problems, referred to as near-separable {NMF}, that can be solved efficiently (that is, in polynomial time), even in the presence of noise --this is the how. Finally, we briefly describe some problems in mathematics and computer science closely related to {NMF} via the nonnegative rank.},

be a useful decomposition for multivariate data. Two different multi- 
plicative algorithms for {NMF} are analyzed. They differ only slightly in 
the multiplicative factor used in the update rules. One algorithm can be 
shown to minimize the conventional least squares error while the other 
minimizes the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence. The monotonic 
convergence of both algorithms can be proven using an auxiliary func- 
tion analogous to that used for proving convergence of the Expectation- 
Maximization algorithm. The algorithms can also be interpreted as diag- 
onally rescaled gradient descent, where the rescaling factor is optimally 
chosen to ensure convergence.},

	abstract = {The analysis and visualization of weighted networks pose many challenges, which have led to the development of techniques for extracting the network's backbone, a subgraph composed of only the most significant edges. Weighted edges are particularly common in bipartite projections (e.g. networks of co-authorship, co-attendance, co-sponsorship), which are often used as proxies for one-mode networks where direct measurement is impractical or impossible (e.g. networks of collaboration, friendship, alliance). However, extracting the backbone of bipartite projections requires special care. This paper reviews existing methods for extracting the backbone from bipartite projections, and proposes a new method that aims to overcome their limitations. The stochastic degree sequence model ({SDSM}) involves the construction of empirical edge weight distributions from random bipartite networks with stochastic marginals, and is demonstrated using data on bill sponsorship in the 108th U.S. Senate. The extracted backbone's validity as a network reflecting political alliances and antagonisms is established through comparisons with data on political party affiliations and political ideologies, which offer an empirical ground-truth. The projection and backbone extraction methods discussed in this paper can be performed using the -onemode- command in Stata.},

	abstract = {This article provides an ethical analysis of the moral conflict over access to premium audio-visual online content, which is currently regulated by geo-blocking in the domain of digital film distribution. We first identify the stakeholders of this conflict, which are the rights holders on the one hand – that is, creators, producers and distributors of audio-visual content – and the consumers of audio-visual content on the other. We also identify their interests, moral rights and moral intuitions based on interviews with representatives of the interested parties and by conducting an analysis of their position papers on the Digital Single Market strategy initiatives presented by the European Commission in the years 2015 to 2018. The moral rights and legitimate interests of stakeholders are then balanced and specified. We propose four ethical principles that set out the conditions under which the geo-blocking of audio-visual content is either ethically justified or unjustified.},

	abstract = {Geoblocking has been presented both as an evil perpetrated against the Internet and as the savior of content on the Internet. The European Commission regards geoblocking as undesirable and aims to eliminate geoblocking within the European Union to the extent possible. Although the Commission’s 2015 proposed cross-border portability regulation and its 2016 proposed anti-geoblocking regulation would not eliminate geoblocking entirely, the two regulations would significantly limit the instances in which geoblocking would be legal. Content creators, such as motion picture studios, take a different position on geoblocking: they see geoblocking as a helpful means to partition markets, maintain distribution schedules, and secure financing based on territorially-defined distribution. For content providers such as small online radio stations, geoblocking may be the only way to conduct business if these stations rely on affordable, but territorially-limited, licenses. This article reviews the recent legal developments concerning geoblocking and considers whether the future of the Internet can and should include geoblocking. Recent developments suggest that geoblocking is receiving a greater role in the legal context: legislators, courts, and regulators are considering geoblocking as an effective and necessary means of territorially limiting on the Internet the effects of their laws, judgments, and decisions. Because there are no uniform global laws that would govern activities on the Internet without respect to where those activities occur in the world, some form of geoblocking might be needed to address specific circumstances.},

Even so, efforts to compel and restrict speech appearing in private venues like social media continue to expand in scope and number at both the state and federal level. We first explore Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L. in the context of student speech cases before discussing how the decision destroys the traditional boundary of the schoolhouse gate for the regulation of student speech. It does so despite the fact that the cheerleader's profane messages would have been protected expression in any nonschool situation. We then argue that Mahanoy, despite being an individual win for the cheerleader, illustrates how the Court continues to wrestle with traditional applications of the First Amendment to internet speech. We argue that the decision has the regulation of internet speech following a path similar to the regulation of broadcast speech.},

Four “Prometheus” decisions from the Third Circuit span a seventeen-year legal impasse that highlighted the agency’s shortcomings on effective minority ownership policies. Now, after the Supreme Court’s 2021 decision in {FCC} v. Prometheus Radio Project, the {FCC} is required to relaunch its media ownership policy in 2022. This paper explores how the {FCC} has interpreted diversity in media ownership policymaking by examining a range of diversity policies and assessment methodologies particularly regarding minority ownership. The paper then presents data from a thirty-year period to demonstrate that the impasse of the Prometheus cases corresponded with significant growth in minority station ownership. Results of a series of independent empirical tests examining the connection between ownership and diversity, and assessing the diversity of content production in broadcast radio by company size and ownership by race and ethnicity, are discussed in the context of the legal rulings.},

	abstract = {Transborder flow of digitized goods and services has become a major feature in the debate over Internet regulation.  Some commentators have argued that the architecture of the Internet changes everything; others have replied that it changes nothing.  This updated article addresses federalism issues raised by on-line interjurisdictional competition, arguing that despite the suggestions of the "unexceptionalist" school of commentary, Internet regulation remains anything but "business as usual."  Analysis of interstate competition in law as a product is appropriate in determining the proper scope of state regulation of on-line activity. Two lines of constitutional cases define the parameters of proper interstate regulatory competition: those dealing with personal jurisdiction, and those dealing with the dormant commerce clause. Inherent in the Supreme Court's Due Process holdings is the principle that interstate diversity in law products is desireable and central to a federal system. The minimum contacts test of International Shoe and subsequent cases preserves the individual's right to vote with his feet in selecting among the law products offered by the several states. Competition for law as a product can only be maintained if states are prevented from externalizing the costs of their local regulations. The Supreme Court holdings regarding the dormant commerce clause indicate that this constitutional doctrine serves to prevent states from exporting their law products to other jurisdictions by attempting to control wholly extraterritorial activity. Although the Internet may in some cases facilitate externalization of state regulatory costs, centralized regulation by the federal government, rather than overreaching by the states, is the proper solution to such externalities.},

It does so in intervals of five years over a 25-year period, using fiscal observations for 31,804 units of local government in 787 metropolitan counties across the contiguous United States. Specifically explored is the effect of tax and expenditure limitations on the variation in revenues and expenditures between general purpose governments and school districts within county areas. Rather than imposing a uniform constraint across jurisdictions, tax and expenditure limitations (℡s) are associated with increased variation across both general purpose and school district revenues and expenditures and, by implication, increased service differentials. Effects are found to be asymmetric, with increased variation greatest within counties comprising the urban core and those with relatively more disadvantaged populations. The implications are that ℡s are most constraining on the ability of governments serving economically less prosperous and at risk populations to meet public service needs. Such differential effects are of more than questionable merit and are the result of the application of blunt instruments to what is often an undemonstrated need. The outcome impairs both the efficiency and responsiveness of the local public sector.},

To test our research hypothesis, this study focuses on a cross-section of municipalities throughout the U.S. during and shortly after the 2008-09 recession. Using multiple data sources from the Government Finance Officers Association ({GFOA}) and American Community Survey ({ACS}), we employ a panel data from 2008 to 2011 which covers the period of the Great Recession to best capture cutback strategies during a period of severe fiscal distress. We observed differences in fiscal outcomes based on the severity of the municipal {TELs}. Municipalities constrained by more stringent {TELs} received more intergovernmental aid, incurred higher debt service expenditures and experienced less net capital investment during the most recent recessionary period. These findings support the argument that {TELs}, which are often neglected in discussions of cutback strategies, should be given greater consideration. This study helps shed light on the theoretical and empirical investigations of cutback strategies by offering the concept of institutional constraints and its impact on cutback strategies.},

This paper describes the scope of this activity, analyzes the major differences among the alternative relief mechanisms, and offers an explanation of why property tax relief increased to such an extent. With rapid inflation of home prices and modern assessment practices, the share of property taxes impacting on homeowners tends to rise. Many of the relief measures merely offset this tendency rather than lowered property taxes in absolute terms.},

	abstract = {To interpret elections, social scientists and media pundits often ask: how much did particular groups, or voting blocs, contribute to a candidate’s vote total? The default tool for studying voter behavior — regressions of vote choice on voter characteristics — is useful for evaluating correlates and determinants of vote choice, but is incapable of assessing how many votes a group contributes. Accounting for votes also requires knowing a group’s size and its turnout rate. We introduce a set of tools for estimating how many votes a bloc gives to a candidate, how voting bloc patterns diﬀer from prior elections, and how support changes under counterfactuals. We apply these tools to study U.S. presidential elections, demonstrating that there is little evidence to show Black and Latino voters are shifting toward Republicans in recent elections and that Donald Trump’s support was concentrated among voters with moderate attitudes toward racial outgroups.},

	abstract = {This dissertation analyses the dynamics of {EU} policy making through a structured and focused comparison with two other federal polities: the United States and Switzerland. To this end, it draws on the wider comparative federalism literature to examine how basic federal political institutions structure the development of policy outcomes. The empirical focus is on the regulatory challenge posed by the internet's spectacular proliferation during the period of 1995-2005. Two hypotheses are formulated as to how basic federal political institutions shape the development of policy outcomes in the three polities under investigation. First, given the cross-border nature of the policy challenge, we expect to find similar interactions among the different levels of government in all three units of analysis. In particular, federal level political actors should be similarly mobilised into offering centralising solutions to problems with cross-border effects. Furthermore, this could provoke allocational shifts in authority towards the centre in the three units of analysis. Second, it is expected that differences in the policy process and the ‘power capabilities’ of the centre help to explain the variance in policy outcomes. The main findings of the empirical investigation suggest that the dynamics of policymaking in the realm of internet regulation exhibit similarities that make {EU} comparison with other federal polities across these dimensions especially revealing. This is particularly the case when comparing the {EU} with polities characterised by an extremely decentralised federal configuration, institutionally weak centres, consensual modes of decision-making, and decentralised modes of policy implementation such as Switzerland.},

Focusing on the consequences of different types of {TELs} for revenue and expenditure structure, Philip Joyce and Daniel Mullins offer some interesting findings. They found that the level and share of state and local taxes were influenced in some unexpected ways. {TELs} imposed on state governments had little or no impact on increasing reliance on general tax revenues sources. Where both state and local governments faced limitations, the consequences were greater for local tax structures than for the state. States characterized by local {TELs} did show short-term overall declines in both state and local tax levels; in the long term, however, state taxes increased in those states. In the area of state aid to localities, Joyce and Mullins found a link between {TELs} and increased aid, although the evidence indicates that some increases may be attributed to other forces and trends. Finally, Joyce and Mullins found that with the exception of public welfare expenditures, state-level {TELs} had little impact on the relative amount each government level spent in various functional categories. Where limitations were imposed on both state and local governments, the state was found to be more reluctant to assume increasing burdens. Joyce and Mullins raise a variety of questions addressing the relationship between {TELs} and other forces that influence the structure of state and local revenues and expenditures. They also raise issues regarding the "offsetting" effects of different types of {TELs}, the distribution of state aid, and the impacts of {TELs} on the structure of local governance.},

            Tax and expenditure limits ({TELs}) are restrictions placed on governments limiting their ability to collect and spend revenue. Residents support these {TELs}, as they desire lower tax burdens and more government efficiency; yet, residents still desire the same level of public services. Property tax rate limits, a specific type of {TEL}, are placed upon local governments to limit their ability to collect revenue and expand authority. Rate limits were implemented on the assumption that governments would tax at their highest maximum possible rate, but this is not always the case. This article studies why some local governments choose not to utilize their maximum allotted property tax rate. Using an open systems governance approach, a panel data analysis was conducted using data from 67 Florida counties from 2008 to 2017. Results of the analysis show that the use of special districts and the age of the residential population have significant effects on property tax rate decisions.},

This article argues that control of the property tax is critical to the workings of local representative democracy, affecting both the discretion of elected officials and participation of citizens. It presents both quantitative and qualitative evidence of the centralization trend, including changes in property-tax flows and state finances affecting local governments, an analysis of the comparative severity of property-tax limitations, changes in K-12 education financing, and local consequences of the tax limitations.},

	abstract = {The world has now experienced what could be regarded as 20 years of Institutional Liberalism: the dominance of the view that cooperation in world politics can be enhanced through the construction and support of multilateral institutions based on liberal principles. E. H. Carr was famously skeptical of liberalism as he understood that tradition. This essay, prepared originally as the E. H. Carr Lecture at Aberystwyth University, interrogates Institutional Liberalism through a lens provided by Carr’s most famous book on international relations, The Twenty Years’ Crisis. It points out three trends since the 1990s that may be associated with Institutional Liberalism: increasing legalization; trends toward more legalism and moralism; and a decline in the coherence of some international regimes. Reviewing these trends in light of Realist critiques of liberalism, the essay rejects Realism as a good moral or practical guide to world politics, but reaffirms the value of the Realist view that institutions depend on structures of power and interests. Increases in legalization, legalism and moralism reflect a fusion of the social purpose of liberal democracies with their unprecedented geopolitical power since 1991. But declines in the coherence of international regimes reflect a greater divergence of interests, weighted by power. All international institutions are flawed and in some ways precarious, but strengthening them in ways that reflect legitimate social purposes remains a major challenge for our time.},

Analyzing contemporary novels, journalistic chronicles, testimonial works, and documentaries, the book reveals the political potential of these communities’ vulnerability and victimization portrayed in these fictional and non-fictional representations.

Esch grounds her analysis in important rereadings of canonical texts by Martín Luis Guzman, Nellie Campobello, Omar Cabezas, Gioconda Belli, Sergio Ramirez, Horacio Castellanos Moya, and others. Through the lens of the iconic firearm, Esch relates the story of the peasant insurgencies of the Mexican Revolution, the guerrilla warfare of the Sandinista Revolution, and the ongoing drug-related wars in Mexico and Central America, to highlight the historical, cultural, gendered, and political significance of weapons in this volatile region"--},

	title = {Operation Condor, the War on Drugs, and Counterinsurgency in the Golden Triangle (1977–1983)},
	abstract = {In the late 1960s, the Mexican government launched a series of counternarcotics campaigns characterized by the militarization of drug production zones, particularly in the northwestern region—the so-called Golden Triangle, epicenter of both production and trafficking of marijuana and opium poppy since the 1930s. Operations Canador (1969–1975) and Trizo (1976) served as a laboratory for methods to curb drug production, ranging from harassment of drug growers to the aerial defoliation of illicit crops. Operation Condor (1977–1988) combined and enhanced these strategies, wreaking havoc on communities of alleged drug growers, but without entirely disrupting the drug industry. This paper explores the role of the {US} government in the militarization of Mexico’s anti-drug policy, underscoring how the ruling party (the Institutional Revolutionary Party, {PRI}) took advantage of this shift to tackle domestic issues and reassert its hegemony. I argue that Operation Condor functioned as a counterinsurgency campaign oriented to thwart both social and armed movements, eliminate competitors in the narcotics market, and reorganize the drug industry to protect successful drug lords. Operation Condor also caused the decentralization of the drug industry from the northwest and created a new clientelistic pact between drug lords and national security agencies, such as the Federal Security Directorate 
({DFS}), the Office of the Attorney General of Mexico–Federal Judicial Police ({PGR}-{PJF}), and the Secretariat of National Defense ({SEDENA}), which benefited from drug proceeds. Finally, the de facto state of siege imposed in the Golden Triangle produced thousands of victims of harassment, torture, rape, murder, forced-disappearance, and displacement; massive human rights abuses that authorities either concealed or denied.},

At low use levels the state is pleasurable, but at high levels fear, anxiety, and paranoia increase, and ultimately reality contact breaks down. Q-sort, Semantic Differential, and other data suggest that low-level users take cocaine to overcome personal insecurities and relieve boredom. Heavy users take it to support overvaulting ambitions and intense strivings for self-sufficiency. Psychotherapy with such persons must deal with their counterdependency, anger, and despair, and with their underlying sense of betrayal. These persons have unacknowledged needs for spiritual experience that must be dealt with openly. A description of persons most vulnerable to heavy use of cocaine is provided, and recommendations for research and social policy are presented.},

In this review article, we explain why and how. Drawing from scholarly, journalistic, and policy sources we identify and theorize the political-economic logics and grounded processes underlying the pervasive nexus of agrarian change, clandestine activities, and illicit capital. We first outline three key elements of the political economic context that create and enable land acquisition by drug traffickers. We then elucidate narcos’ multiple motives for acquiring, transforming, and holding rural landed property. Ultimately, we make a case for understanding drug traffickers as a “narco-bourgeoisie” due to their use of cocaine profits to establish and extend private property relations into erstwhile communal and protected lands that were previously unavailable for capital accumulation. We argue that theorizing drug traffickers in this way better captures the relationship between drug control policy and capitalism, and the role of illicit capital in land use change.},

	abstract = {According to a conventional evolutionary perspective, the human propensity for substance use is the product of a ‘mismatch’ between emotional mechanisms that evolved in a past without pure drugs or direct routes of drug administration, and the occurrence of these phenomena in the contemporary environment. The primary purpose of this review is to assert that, contrary to the conventional view, humans have shared a coevolutionary relationship with psychotropic plant substances that is millions of years old. We argue that this ‘deep time’ relationship is self-evident both in the extant chemical–ecological adaptations that have evolved in mammals to metabolize psychotropic plant substances and in the structure of plant defensive chemicals that have evolved to mimic the structure, and interfere with the function, of mammalian neurotransmitters. Given this evidence, we question how emotional mechanisms easily triggered by plant toxins can have evolved. Our argument is also supported with archeological and historical evidence of substance use in antiquity suggesting that, for people in the past, psychotropic plant substances were as much a mundane everyday item as they are for many people today. Our second, and more speculative objective is to suggest provisional hypotheses of human substance-using phenomena that can incorporate the evolutionary implications of a deep time relationship between psychotropic substances and people. We discuss hypotheses of selective beneﬁts of substance use, including the idea that neurotransmitter-analog plant chemicals were exploited as substitutes for costly, nutritionally constrained endogenous neurotransmitters. However, even if substance seeking was adaptive in the environment of our hominid ancestors, it may not still be so in the contemporary environment. Thus, the implications of our argument are not that the mismatch concept does not apply to human substance-using phenomena, but that it must be reconsidered and extended to incorporate the implications of a substance-rich, rather than substance-free, evolutionary past.},

In this article, I discuss the issue in three parts, namely internment camps for Uyghurs, urban internment and virtual internment. While all of them have both physical and psychological aspects, the last two are based on an Orwelian use of surveillance technologies for the purpose of large-scale persecution and suppression of Uyghurs with the intention of achieving a China with one homogenous culture. The total internment which is currently being carried out has two main motives: Islamophobia and the crucial geo-strategical position of the Uyghur homeland.},

	shorttitle = {Anarchy is what States Make of it},
	abstract = {The claim that international institutions can transform state interests is central to neoliberal challenges to the realist assumption that "process" (interaction and learning among states) cannot fundamentally affect system "structure" (anarchy and the distribution of capabilities). Systematic development of this claim, however, has been hampered by the neoliberals' commitment to rational choice theory, which treats interests as exogenously given and thus offers only a weak form of institutional analysis. A growing body of international relations scholarship points to ways in which the identities and interests of states are socially constructed by knowledgeable practice. This article builds a bridge between this scholarship and neoliberalism by developing a theory of identity- and interest-formation in support of the neoliberal claim that international institutions can transform state interests. Its substantive focus is the realist view that anarchies are necessarily self-help systems, which justifies disinterest in processes of identity- and interest-formation. Self-help is a function not of anarchy but of process and, as such, is itself an institution that determines the meaning of anarchy and the distribution of power for state action. The article concludes with an examination of how this institution can be transformed by practices of sovereignty, by an evolution of cooperation, and by critical strategic practice.},

	title = {Genetic Fiduciaries, Rethinking Genome Governance},
	abstract = {Exploitative practices permeate the “genetic sphere” of biomedicine and biotechnology. Entities such as genetic testing and biotech companies, laboratories, biobanks, research institutions, and government agencies employ various practices to extract as much value as possible from genetic material and information. Exploitative practices include requiring individuals to waive property rights over genetic material and information; using these resources for purposes other than those for which they were obtained without the individuals’ knowledge or understanding of the implications of such use; or collecting these resources surreptitiously without any significant oversight or accountability. Such practices steer genetic material and information toward the ends of powerful entities while undermining individuals’ property and privacy interests. They result in “appropriative harms.”

Exploitative practices cannot be surmounted within the existing legal framework. This framework is fragmented, excessively narrow, and riddled with inconsistencies. It fails to provide meaningful protection against exploitative practices and does not address the profound power asymmetries between individuals and powerful entities that collect, use, and share genetic material and information. This Article addresses this gap by laying the theoretical and regulatory groundwork for future legal reform. It creates a new statutory category of “genetic fiduciaries,” proposing to impose quasi-fiduciary duties of loyalty and care on every entity in the genetic sphere, whether public or private; enacts a new federal law with broad applicability and scope; and establishes a new federal agency with rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement responsibilities.},

It argues that protest against the privatization of water utilities in Bolivia must be understood within the context of neoliberal economic restructuring and the emergence of what has been termed the "new working class," which is now primarily urban and engaged in informal forms of work.},

Latin American countries show a mixed picture, confirming the idea that the resource curse is not a deterministic phenomenon and that dependence on, rather than abundance of, natural resources is associated with developmental failures. When looking beyond the nation state, local communities may benefit from royalties accruing to regional governments, often, though, at the expense of other socioeconomic liabilities (as in the case of negative environmental externalities). The case of Ecuador is in many ways exemplary of the resource curse in Latin America and the failure of policies to overcome the curse. While the country was always a commodity exporter, the intensification of extractive activities and the expansion of the extractive frontier (over the last five decades) intensified the severity of boom-and-bust cycles and compromised socio-environmental values in the vicinity of extractive activity.},

Statistical models that estimate the spatial locations of individual decision-makers have made a key contribution to this success. Spatial models have been estimated for the U.S. Congress, the Supreme Court, U.S. presidents, a large number of non-U.S. legislatures, and supranational organizations. Yet one potentially fruitful laboratory for testing spatial theories, the individual U.S. states, has remained relatively unexploited, for two reasons. First, state legislative roll call data have not yet been systematically collected for all states over time. Second, because ideal point models are based on latent scales, comparisons of ideal points across states or even between chambers within a state are difficult. This article reports substantial progress on both fronts. First, we have obtained the roll call voting data for all state legislatures from the mid-1990s onward. Second, we exploit a recurring survey of state legislative candidates to allow comparisons across time, chambers, states as well as with the U.S. Congress. The resulting mapping of America's state legislatures has great potential to address numerous questions not only about state politics and policymaking, but also about legislative politics in general.},

This paper introduces and demonstrates a substantially expanded version of the backbone package for R, which now provides methods for extracting backbones from weighted networks, weighted bipartite projections, and unweighted networks. For each type of network, fully replicable code is presented first for small toy examples, then for complete empirical examples using transportation, political, and social networks. The paper also demonstrates the implications of several issues of statistical inference that arise in backbone extraction. It concludes by briefly reviewing existing applications of backbone extraction using the backbone package, and future directions for research on network backbone extraction.},

Recent changes in Congress point to the polarization of women, where Democratic women remain more liberal than Democratic men but Republican women are no different from, or more conservative than, Republican men. We use newly available state legislative roll-call data to determine whether women state legislators are more liberal or polarized than male copartisans. We find that while Democratic women state legislators remain consistently more liberal than male copartisans in most state chambers, Republican women legislators are growing more conservative. Thus, women state legislators are increasingly polarized in most U.S. states. Legislator replacement and increasing polarization among state legislators in office contribute to this effect. We argue that polarization among women legislators has implications for the representation of women in the states.},

Recent methodological innovations in the analysis of roll-call data have produced a number of important theoretical insights, such as understanding the structure of congressional decisionmaking and the role of parties and ideology in Congress. Many of the methodological innovations and theoretical questions sparked by congressional scholarship have been difficult to test at the state level because of the lack of comprehensive data on various forms of state legislative behavior, including roll-call voting. The Representation in Americas Legislatures project rectifies that problem through collection of comprehensive state legislative roll-call votes across all 99 state legislative chambers for the 1999-2000 and 2003-04 legislative sessions. In this article, we describe the data available through this project as well as our data acquisition procedures, including Stata and Perl programming and {OCR} of paper documents, with suggestions about how to use these methods to collect a wide range of state-level data.},

We conduct Monte Carlo simulations altering assumptions regarding the dimensionality and distribution of member preferences and scale the resulting roll call matrices. Our simulations show that party polarization generates misleading evidence in favor of low dimensionality. This suggests that the increasing levels of party polarization in recent Congresses may have produced false evidence in favor of a low-dimensional policy space. However, we show that focusing more narrowly on each party caucus in isolation can help researchers discern the true dimensionality of the policy space in the context of significant party polarization. We re-examine the historical roll call record and find evidence suggesting that the low dimensionality of the contemporary Congress may reflect party polarization rather than changes in the dimensionality of policy conflict.},

The activity of parties in the electoral arena explains part of this variance, with more active parties having more influence.

The analysis is divided into two stages: the founding phase (the 1990s) that begins with the arrival of the Special Period; and the consolidation stage, which starts with the new century, in particular since 2007 with the ‘updating model’ that has begun to push deeper changes. This periodisation, in stages that are associated with different state strategies, seeks a comparison to assess the impacts of each of the challenges and proposals facing civil society.},

	abstract = {This article examines the global impact of China's post-Mao transformation as reflected in Sino-Cuban relations. China and Cuba resumed their comradeship after Castro endorsed China's crackdown of the 1989 pro-democracy movement, and since then Beijing has promoted its approach towards legitimizing the one-party regime through engaging in economic reforms and opening to the world to Havana. "China's lesson for Cuba" has been discussed by many Cubanists worldwide. However, the Chinese approach has posed a dilemma to Fidel Castro: he admires China's power but has doubts about the future of socialism in China. The article argues that Castro has so far adopted his old strategy for dealing with Soviet influence in the 1960s in his engagement with China: praising his political ally's power as the evidence of socialism's vitality for his domestic consumption, while significantly limiting the application of China's economic policies. But his more pragmatic successors, Raul Castro in particular, may adopt the Chinese approach.},

	doi = {10.2139/ssrn.1763846},
	shorttitle = {Civil Society 2.0?},
	abstract = {In the debate over the role of civil society under authoritarian regimes, the spread of transnational web-based media obliges us to rethink the arenas in which the societal voice can be raised - and heard. Taking the case of state-socialist Cuba, a diachronic comparison analyzes civil society dynamics prior to the Internet - in the early to mid-1990s, and a decade later, after digital and web-based media made their way onto the island. The study finds that in the pre-Internet period, the focus was on behind-the-scenes struggles for associational autonomy within the state-socialist framework. A decade later, web-based communication technologies have supported the emergence of a new type of public sphere in which the civil society debate is marked by autonomous citizen action. While this defies the socialist regime’s design of state-society relations, its effect on democratization depends on the extent to which a web-based voice connects with off-line public debate and social action.},
